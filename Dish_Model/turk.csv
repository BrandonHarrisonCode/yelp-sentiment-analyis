review
"Went in for a lunch. Steak sandwich was delicious, and the Caesar salad had an absolutely delicious dressing, with a perfect amount of dressing, and distributed perfectly across each leaf. I know I'm going on about the salad ... But it was perfect.  Drink prices were pretty good.  The Server, Dawn, was friendly and accommodating. Very happy with her.  In summation, a great pub experience. Would go again!"
"I'll be the first to admit that I was not excited about going to La Tavolta. Being a food snob, when a group of friends suggested we go for dinner I looked online at the menu and to me there was nothing special and it seemed overpriced.  Im also not big on ordering pasta when I go out. Alas, I was outnumbered. Thank goodness! I ordered the sea bass special. It was to die for. Cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, perfect portion. I can not say enough good things about this dish. When the server asked how it was he seemed very proud of the dish and said, "" doesn't she (the chef) do an incredible job?"" She does.   My hubby got the crab tortellini and also loved his. I heard ""mmmm this is so good"" from all around the table. Our waiter was super nice and even gave us free desserts because we were some of the last people in the restaurant. Service was very slow and the place was PACKED but we had our jugs of wine and a large group with good conversation so it didn't seem to bother anyone.  So-  Do order the calamari and fried zucchini appetizers. Leave out the mussels.   If they have the sea bass special, I highly recommend it. The chicken parm and crab tortellini were also very good and very big. The chicken Romano was a bit bland. The house salads were teeny.   Do make a reservation but still expect to wait for your food. Go with a large group of people and plan for it to be loud. Don't go with a date unless you're fighting and don't feel like hearing anything they have to say.  Ask to sit in the side room if it's available."
"Tracy dessert had a big name in Hong Kong and the one in First Markham place has been here for many years now!   Came in for some Chinese dessert, and I must say their selection has increased tremendously over the years. I might as well add that the price has also increased tremendously as well. The waitress gave us tea, which I could taste had red date in it. Fancy!  A simple taro with coconut with tapioca pearls was like $5.25 or something. Basically all the desserts were more than $5. That's crazy! I can literally just make this dessert at home and for a bowl, it would probably cost like $0.50. A few years ago, I think I can still get it for like $3-$4, which is more reasonable, but wow, more than $5 is a little over the top for this dessert. Though I must say, it is Tracy Dessert, and they are a little more on the expensive side.   I also saw other items on the menu like fish balls, chicken wings, shaved ice. My friend got a mango drink with fresh mango in it!   I'm also surprised how many people come to Tracy Dessert after work. We came on a Sunday and the tables were always filled. I think the amount of tables they had were just perfect because no one really waited for seats for a long time, but the tables kept filling up once a table was finished."
"This place has gone down hill.  Clearly they have cut back on staff and food quality  Many of the reviews were written before the menu changed.  I've been going for years and the food quality has gone down hill.  The service is slow & my salad, which was $15, was as bad as it gets.  It's just not worth spending the money on this place when there are so many other options."
"Like walking back in time, every Saturday morning my sister and I was in a bowling league and after we were done, we'd spend a few quarters playing the pin ball machines until our mother came to pick us up.  My sister was daring and play the machines hard, she was afraid of that ""tilt"" showing up and freezing the game.  I, on the other hand was a bit more gentler and wanted to make sure I got my quarter's worth.  This place has rows and rows of machines, some are really old and some are more of a mid 80's theme.  There is even a Ms pac man!  It was fun to spend an afternoon playing the machines and remembering all the fun of my early teen years."
"Walked in around 4 on a Friday afternoon, we sat at a table just off the bar and walked out after 5 min or so. Don't even think they realized we walked in. However everyone at the bar noticed we walked in!!! Service was non existent at best. Not a good way for a new business to start out. Oh well, the location they are at has been about 5 different things over the past several years, so they will just be added to the list. SMDH!!!"
"Wow. So surprised at the one and two star reviews!  We started with the most tender calamari. Although the marinara sauce was a bit bland, but a touch of salt made it just right. My husband had the veal with peppers and said it was so delicious and tender. The mashed potatoes were perfect. I had the salmon Diablo which was also delicious. Our salad was beautiful! Dressing was served on the salad and it was a nice amount. We ended our delicious meal with a piece of tiramisu. Our server Matt was right on!! Very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. Our appetizer, salad and entrees were timed perfectly. I love salad and did not mind that my entree was served while I was still eating it! No problem it let my dinner cool to just the right temp for me to eat it comfortably.  I wonder sometimes if people just don't appreciate relaxing and taking time to eat a wonderful and beautifully prepared meal.  A wonderful atmosphere. So relaxing. The chairs are super comfortable too!!! We will certainly be back.  Give it a try.  Don't  always go by the reviews.  A bottle of Riesling, calamari app, two delicious entrees and dessert for $92!  Well with it."
"I cannot believe how things have changed in 3 years. I picked up duck congee sometime in the winter when my hubby was sick.  I was very disappointed because the ginger fish sauce tasted like it had gone bad (it should never be bitter).  Today, my hubby wanted to eat there since he was craving the duck congee and most places don't serve the duck & coleslaw side. We waited about 10 minutes to get our menu.  After we placed our orders, we waited another 5 minutes to get the tea that most places bring with the menu.  I could go on with the details but the gist of the story is they were understaffed or the staff was slow.  The worst part of it was that the service.  The servers make us feel bad for asking for anything (like when they took our order).  We had arrived and placed our order before another couple bside us at least 10 minutes ahead but somehow, this couple received their pho before mine.  They were almost done eating their pho before mine came out."
"You can't really find anything wrong with this place, the pastas and pizzas are both amazing and high quality, the price is very reasonable, the owner and the staff are very friendly, if you're in downtown check this place out, a lot of people think just because it's downtown there are lots of options around but that's not always the case as there is also a lot of poor quality food in downtown as well."
Great lunch today. Staff was very helpful in assisting with selections and knowledgeable on the ingredients. We enjoyed the BBQ chicken with tika masala sauce and really good naan bread. The biryani with chicken was also yummy! Fun to see the food being prepared in the tandoori ovens. Great addition to the fast casual scene in Cleveland.
"I love chinese food and I love mexican food. What can go wrong? A couple of things. First things first, this place is more of a ""rice bowl"" kind of place. I thought it was going to be more diverse as far as the menu goes, but its mainly rice bowls you get with different kinds of meats. The ordering was a little confusing at first, but one of the employees helped us out and I got the 2-item bowl and got the jade chicken and hengrenade chicken with all rice(jerk). I also ordered a jade chicken quesadilla on the side.  I'm gonna admit, this place looks kinda dirty. I don't think Arizona uses those health department letter grade system like California does, but if I were to just judge by how it looked inside, i'd give it a ""C"" grade lol. We waited for about 15 minutes or so and finally got our food. We took it to go and ate at our hotel room.   Mmmm... the food was just alright. The jade chicken was nothing special. It tasted like any generic chinese fast food orange chicken/sesame chicken variant. The hengrenade chicken, although was the less spicier version of the jerk chicken, was still pretty spicy for me. Just be warned the jerk chicken is super spicy. If you aren't sure, ask for a sample at the restaurant before ordering, but it was way too spicy for me.   The jade chicken quesadilla was decent, but nothing special. Just imagine orange chicken in between a tortilla and cheese. A friend of mine ordered a jade chicken burrito and we were confused when we pulled it out of the bag because it was literally the size of Mcdonald's apple pie. If you order the burrito, be warned that it's a burrito for gnomes and smurfs, but he said it was tasty.   They provide a snicker doodle sugar cookie for each meal and it was decent, again nothing special.   Not gonna lie, the next day my stomach felt like a little mexican dude and chinese dude were wrestling and throwing molotov cocktails inside. I used the bathroom like 5 times. I don't recommend eating this place if you have a lot to do the next day."
"We've been a huge Slim's fan since they opened one up in Texas about two years ago when we used to live there. This place never disappoints. They even have great salads and grilled chicken. Plus they have fresh brewed sweet tea, it's the best!"
"Good selection of classes of beers and mains. I've been here twice.  First time I had the fried chicken. It was delicious, but be warned, extremely salty. I couldn't even finish the last piece of chicken after experiencing a salt overload.  Second time we came on a wednesday. We didn't know it was BBQ night, where they have a completely different menu, and don't offer anything from their original vegetarian-friendly menu. This menu has one vegetarian-friendly option - an eggplant sandwich. The vegetarian in my party said it was awful. Also, on BBQ night you choose 2 sides. Except they were out of all their sides except 2 - fries and potato salad. I can't say I was thrilled to have carb heavy sides with my carb heavy main. How do you run out of sides so early in the evening?  Service not so great.  I'd avoid coming here on wednesdays."
"Our family LOVES the food here. Quick, friendly, delicious, and a great restaurant to take kids to. 5 stars!"
"If you are looking for the best pierogies in Pittsburgh, this is your place. There are a few small tables outside but most of the business is carry out. Pierogies Plus wins Best Pierogies every year. Why? Because the owner is from Poland and she is making the real deal pierogies. The best part is that they are hand pinched by a group of older Polish and Hungarian women.  The biggest seller is potato and cheese but they sell many flavors. They are like plump pillows of softness. You can buy them buy the dozen. You can get them cold to take home and freeze or warm and ready to eat. The warm ones are served with butter and onions.  It's definitely a comfort food. The best part is that they ship internationally. Yes, they are that good."
"The food is always good and the prices are reasonable.  Although it's not exactly a restaurant -- more like a snack bar, limited menu and you walk up to the counter, place your order, wait a minute or so for them to prepare your order, and pay the cashier, then search for a table.  Kind of like a sandwich shop.  Still a much better choice for value than the other hotel Deli's on the strip."
"Pick any meat on the planet and the chef will make a Mexican style dish with amazing flavor! Wow, fish and lamb tacos to die for. Drinks are great as well."
"Great food, great service. Obviously fried chicken isn't the healthiest food on earth, but once a month I get that craving for good fried chicken. Their chicken is great, doesn't seem too fatty, and their sides are excellent too. A+"
their pettuccine was fresh-made in the morning. it was very delicate and yummy! the owner and staffs are super kind and delightful. We also had Veal piccata. it was classic! love this restaurant.
"if i can give this place no stars i would, i only had their hot pot though, so im not a good judge for anything besides their shabu. i must say, quantity was small, price is expensive for the quality and quantity, and the taste of the soup base is bland as if they just put hot water in. the sauce selection is limited and not very fresh/clean from my perspective. i love hot pot and i would never go back again because home made hot pot can be much better than this place without even trying. anyways, if you have a good appetite for hot pot, you can do yourself a favor and skip this place because it can make you miserable!"
"ended up here because Raku was closed and it received great ratings on Yelp.  I'm so glad I came here.  One of the better meals I've had.  Started off with the mushroom dish and the lettuce wrap.  both were amazing. the lettuce wrap is like having a flavor party in your mouth.  also had the panang duck which was terrific. highly recommend all three dishes. one dish that wasn't so good was the seabass with drunken noodles. overall it was an excellent meal, intimate setting, and great service. definitely will be back."
"Love this place downtown but the Scottsdale location has no manners. Sat at bar for 10 min while bartender ignored us. No menu, no water. We walked out and they could have cared less."
Best chinese resto. Highly recommended. 5 stars. Let us support this business. Best in the west valley. Trust me you wont gi wrong coming to this place
"Came here on a Thursday night at 6:30 p.m. My friends and I had a reservation, but it was not needed - the place was almost empty.  SERVICE: Extremely Poor  While I enjoyed the company of my friends, I would not come back to this restaurant, primarily because of the poor service. Once we were all seated, we were not greeted by anyone for over half an hour, and when someone did come by, we asked whether we could place our orders, to which he said he could not; he's doing something else - so we waited at least another 15 minutes before someone came to finally take our orders.   MAIN: Caprese Salad  The salad was okay - a bit salty for my liking. I personally did not find this dish filling, so I ordered the sweet potato fries as well (See below).  MAIN: Sweet Potato Fries (this was worth it)   These fries were actually very delicious - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. If you visit this restaurant, I would recommend this particular dish, especially given the price ($8) and the portion size (it was quite large - almost the size of a large plate)."
"Went here last weekend and was pretty disappointed. They did not have one thing that was pictured and recommended on yelp as being good. We started off with the steak grilled skewers which were just Ok, nothing special. My freind got the lasagna and I got some special chicken dish. They were both pretty bland and lacking that kick. Our waitress was really nice and got the manger to switch out our dishes. My freind got the hamburger and I got the shrimp scampi. Her hamburger was better then the lasagna but was still lacking flavor. My scampi was better then the chicken but was also still under seasoned and the noodles were a bit under cooked. With such a big name attached to this restaurant and going on such an empty stomach we had such high hopes. The service was great which is why i gave it three stars."
"This place epitomizes the rumored transformation that is in the process of taking place in Pittsburgh. Great food, drinks, and service, but the atmosphere is second to none. Definitely a must visit for locals and visitors alike! You will not feel like you're in ""Pittsburgh""."
Dinner Was Fantastic! Service was great We started with the corn soup and the tuna tartare. We shared the Filet and Scallops. Both delicious entrees! We didn't realize the steak came with potatoes and ordered two sides Mac and cheese and shishito peppers. I thought the peppers were really hot but I'm a whimp I guess! We will definitely come back
"Met a friend for dinner there tonight. The server only brought us one menu. After she brought us a couple of Cokes she didn't come to our table for 20 mins. After trying to get her attention a few times when she walked by we decided to just order off the bartender. We received the starters and the mains at the same time. The wings, brisket, and mac and cheese were alright at best. At this point we hadn't seen the server since she brought the food, so we had to go to the bar for more napkins and refills on the Cokes. The most we actually saw our server was when she hovered over us as we put the tip into the handheld credit card terminal.   Food was somewhere between okay and decent. Service was somewhere between piss poor and terrible."
"Another solid BBQ place in Calgary. This is definitely a great place to go if you are craving something smokey and delicious.   I actually noticed this place because I wandered by when I was walking downtown and it's impossible to miss that lovely smokey/BBQ smell if you're on the block. However, it looks kind of like a hole in the wall. The entrance doesn't look like it's been updated in years, and that's ok because it just adds character. The entire decor is wood/country (to include buffalo head on the wall) and there is also a downstairs where there is live music on the weekends.  Ok onto the food. I have been here a couple of times now, so I think I can comment on the menu pretty well. My friends and I have ordered the brisket, the catfish, the veggie burger, the mac n cheese, the cesar salad, the chili, and the garlic fries. If I had to review this place based on the delicious and garliciness of their fries, this would be a 5-star review hands down. I mean, seriously, vampires beware, but everyone else should enjoy a-plenty.  The portion sizes are huge, so go hungry or be prepared for a to-go box (granted every time I've gone I have loved the food so much that I ate the entire meal.)   I bet at this point in time you are wondering why I am only giving this place 4 stars then? Well, not everything is as amazing as those garlic fries. The bourbon apples are fairly tasteless, the chili is ok (the meat was very tough), and the service is also just ok. However, the catfish is delightful, the mac and cheese is also delicious, and the brisket is quality.   The specialty cocktails are also pretty good, and the beer prices are pretty decent. This is a great place to go for a long lunch, after dinner drink, or even a weekend brunch. There are vegetarian options on the menu (if you can ignore the buffalo head on the wall) and I believe even a few gluten-free options as well. It's a fairly good place to go with a large group, just make sure to call ahead.   All in all, like I said earlier, a great place for good times and smokey flavor."
"Party of 3 ordered the fish tacos, pork belly banh mi, corn beef hash Benedict, and bam ham. Everything was delicious, esp the pork belly banh mi. It's tender and juicy and the baguette was nicely toasted. Love the crispy fish taco too. Their compliment chips and salsa were fresh and super good and crispy. Service was excellent. Our waitress did a great job checking up on us and serving us. I really want other food options too but I'm too full. Next time i visit i will definitely come back."
We had dinner at the Bellagio Buffet last night. The service was OK. Our server was great but kind of forgot about us towards the end of our visit. The food was cold. The only good thing there was the crab legs because they're suppose to be cold and the tacos because it was freshly made. The food was under a single lamp that didn't heat the food at all. We let the server know that the food was cold and he told the manager that was in charge. All she did was come over to ask what the problem was and said she was going to talk to the chief. Have no idea what actually happened though because we didn't see her after that. Half the buffet was closed as well so there wasn't that many options. I must say i rather go to the Rio buffet. For a high end casino this was a horrible experience.
I really enjoyed my visit here. Everything was visually appealing to me. Ambiance was great. Food tasted amazing. Service was . No complaints at all
Flat out fantastic!  Have been here twice and the croissants are the bomb. Can't wait until I can try other items. THE new breakfast spot in Ahwahtukee. The service is great as well. Family run business. Come and support them.
Very nice eating environment and the food are quite nice. Very native Japanese style.
"notes: 1 visit, breakfast/lunch overall: Excellent high-end buffet, but the dessert section needs a little work.  highlights:  - Dip the foccacia pizza in some chimichurri sauce, and it's the best pizza you'll have ever had. - Prime rib is excellent - I hate crab legs in general, but everyone else says they were great here, really fresh. - Cookies!  You must try their cookies.  I got so lucky and grabbed some white chocolate macadamia cookies when they were still warm.  Crispy on the sides and chewy and mouth-wateringly good.  I mean, I was stuffed beyond belief, but I couldn't stop eating it! - If you get in during breakfast time, do try the Portuguese sausage.  It's the only breakfast food really worth it.  Avoid: - Gelato bar looks good, but the texture was more like the soft serve at Dairy Queen. (which I HATE) So disappointed. - Shrimp pad thai was served ice cold.  So gross."
"Such a unique place & a great find. Our waitress was funny, knowledgable, and did a fantastic job. The food was amazing. We will definitely return and recommend this restaurant to other couples!"
"Best Wonton soup ever!!! Delicious food and great service. We had Chicken Satay, Roti C., Wonton soup, and one of the fried noodle and shrimp dishes. Definitely will be back!"
We had dinner here and the food was excellent and the service couldn't have been better! Thanks Jose!  We will be back for sure.
Absolutely love this place! I've been here many times and it never fails to impress me  the bff burger is unreal and the tsoynamis and cupcakes are amazing!! Everything is pretty much the best
"Here's why I don't write reviews for Chinese restaurants: I have to look up their English names...   It's so popular that I didn't try it until recently. The bubble tea here is really good. It's pricier than the one in Rose tea, but you also get more.  I like that noodles with pork sauce. I've tried both the thin and wide/thick noodles. The wide one is less chewy and are kind of sticky. I prefer the thin one for this dish. Dan dan noodles are different from what I was expecting. My friend liked it but it's just okay for me. The noodle with wonton is flavorless to me.  The soup dumplings are good but not amazing. If you've never had it before, give it a try and you probably will like it. I'd like to try noodles with beef soup next time.  The appetizers are too pricy in my opinion. I won't pay $6 for a small plate of vegetables again...  The owner is a nice guy and I enjoyed chatting with him a little bit during dinners."
"We went here Saturday for dinner. We had a 2-1 coupon. Price was $37 for two people so a good deal.   Very large space, open layout.  Been here a few times years ago. I ate mostly the crab legs. Prime rib.   They provide a self serve drink area, which I think is good.  You don't have to flag down a staff to get a drink when you want one. We've all been in that situation.   Unlimited alcohol, wines and beer. They have a bar area with one bartender working and a bunch of tv's to watch or get updates on games.   I wouldn't go out of my way, but if I was in Mirage and hungry, I'd eat there if we had another 2-1 coupon. I wouldn't spend full retail price eating there. Other buffets on the strip are better for same price points."
"Easily entering my top 3 restaurants in Charlotte after just one visit!  Pork Belly, unreal! Had an AMAZING prime NY Strip with bourbon butter jam, PHENOMENAL!"
"So good! They didn't make it to 5 stars due to the prices are a bit high for the amount of food and the location is a bit unsavory.  The decor and atmosphere was surprisingly nice, from the outside I expected to be more run down inside. The staff was very nice. We were surprised how empty the dining room was for a Friday evening. We got Vegetable Samosas to start then ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Rogan Josh, rice and plain Naan. Our only complaint was the lamb could've been more tender but everything was flavorful and delicious.  I would definitely go again if given the chance."
Employees were to busy chatting with each other. One employee had his head out the  drive thru window talking to people the entire time I was there. The cook come from outside and made my food. Did he was hands before making my food???
"This random hole in the wall is located in the Park Rd. shopping center.  I had never heard of it until that fateful St. Patricks day when another beer was in order.  After making my way there and enjoying the patio, I decided the food was my next venture.  After my second, alcohol only, visit, I was excited to taste what vegetarian options they had.  I had the grilled cheese with spicy asparagus and portobello.  Let me tell you...grilled cheese is amazing, add a few interesting touches, it becomes addicting.  I was very happy with my sandwich.  Also, they have a very tasty appetizer of Goat Cheese Fritters with a red wine sauce.  Goat Cheese is one of my favorites and frying anything makes it better. I was in love.   Ther service is great and they can accomadate large groups, the few times I've been has been with 7-20 people.  Great staff, awesome menu choices, I'll be going back"
"Th service here is very hit or miss... Sometimes the staff is personable and attentive. Other times I ask myself, ""Why do I come here???"" The staff often has the  ""GTFOH"" stamp placed permanently across their foreheads, and we as patrons just have to go with it, otherwise we are deemed ""that guy.""  I would say that my continuos visits were for the great HH, but there are several other options close to home, with the same food and drink options for me to choose from. I think today may be last visit..."
Great cocktails and very good food.  Overall first class restaurant.
"I took my wife out for a Birthday dinner with my daughter on 12-16-14  at Alfonsos.  I heard the food was good and it was and my waitress ( Dawn ) was also good ( even with it being very busy ). The problem I have is some of the waitress staff are rude. I had a gift card/ certificate to pay for dinner. After a few minutes, a big blond waitress came over and said  ( in a loud and rude tone ) I couldn't use it cause I needed to spend $100.00 in order to get $50.00 off. She then insulted me by saying (so the tables around me could hear ) couldn't I read the fine print telling me of requirements to use gift card. I showed her the certificate and the fine print was not legible She told me, sorry that's not our fault it's yours and she walked away. I am having second thoughts about going back to use gift card. I may give it away or toss it out."
"Heard about this place and was dying to check it put-and I'm very glad I did! Decent beer selection and kind of a hipster vibe, but $8 for a loaded hot dog and tater tots has got to be one of the best deals in town. Tons of unique toppings to pick from and delicious dipping sauces for tots (secret fry sauce was my fav). We were there early and had no problem getting a seat at the bar, but I can see how during prime time or when live music is on how it could be kind of tight. If you're going for the food is get there earlyu because that loaded dog would have been super hard to eat while standing."
received a  mailer and thought okay let's go. walked in on a Monday afternoon greeted by a bartender wearing a cute  t shirt that said the bar and below that the baby. how cute however never got her name. looked over menu asked what was good she said the club. so ordered it and  yes it is good. had a beer a club on white toast served with fries and watched sport center. really felt at ease there and good music playing. will go back again.
Met an old close friend for dinner at Portofino.  Great intimate dinning with class. Excellent pasta and meat dishes. Delightful service and great drinks. Will come back!
"Yum!! Had the kale grits and would definitely have those again! Menu choices are unique, farm fresh and delicious!"
"ooooooh yummy.  i'm a red meat eating midwestern girl, and 9 had the best steak i can remember having in....who knows how long, it was DAMN GOOD.  the mac and cheese is a tasty, tasty side.  try the snicker dessert...it's basically two cookie/ice cream sanwiches with bits of snickers.  the s'mores my sister got were super fun too.  only complaint is that it was really loud and waaaaaaay too many annoying veil-toting bachelorette parties for my taste.  but hey, it is the palms."
"Dreadful Service  I've had Jimmy John's before several years ago in Minneapolis.. But apparently here in Phoenix, the store personnel must be trained differently. I had to take my sandwich back up to the counter twice to get the thick headed folks working at the one on Camelback at about 16th to get my sandwich the way I wanted it.  I asked for a #10 Hunter's Club with all the veggies. What I got was the standard #10 Hunters Club with lettuce and tomatoes.   After seeing that, I took it back up to the counter, and explained that I wanted all the veggies. They explained to me that those were all the veggies the sandwich came with. I carefully explained that I wanted all of the veggies that they have. The guy said, oh, you want the Freebies. I would have thought he would have clarified when I ordered whether I just wanted everything that came on the sandwich, or the Freebies as well. I said yes, I wanted all of the Freebie Veggies.   I took my revised sandwich and sat down to eat it, only to find that along with the veggies I had requested, they had piled on Italian vinaigrette and Dijon mustard, which I did NOT want."
"These burgers are phenomenal! The Galley Boy just melts in your mouth, and paired with the potato teasers and a milkshake it is like heaven on Earth."
"#1 it should be advertised as a vegetarian dinner. For the price we paid, I really would have liked a nice cut of meat.  #2. Way over priced. Dinner for 2 with (2) blue moon beers and (1) $10 glass of wine... $165+tip. We tipped over 25% because our server was great and the experience of eating in the Dark was a pretty interesting experience.  #3. The food was Meh... I would have been okay with everything else if the food was outstanding. It really wasn't... I probably ate 3 bites of my dinner entree just to taste what the different Ingredients were... It was far from savory and could have used even a pasta or something. A couple of dry (what tasted like hush puppies)?? I would have been impressed a little if when I told the server that I didn't enjoy it if he would have offered to try one of the others, but I didn't make a big deal because like I said before he was really nice. The dessert was literally the only saving grace.  All in all I gave a 2 star... (server and experience in the dark)... I just have to be honest incase others go in expecting a non-vegetarian meal... Be ready for a $200 vegetarian dinner!!!! *** also if they don't like your review on their Facebook page they will block you from commenting on other people talking crap about you, they can not handle the truth and allow others to put you down ***"
"First off food is DELICIOUS! By far my favorite restaurant in downtown Phoenix. I have tried so many different things from the menu and it never disappoints, but the Saturday night special Prime Rib and Horseradish Dauphinoise Potato is my favorite. Second, the service is amazing. Ian is my favorite waiter, will request him every time! He is so personable with a good sense of humor! He constantly is checking up to make sure everything is good (but not too much). He made the experience at the Arrogant Butcher memorable!"
"Wonderful experience. We sat outside on the patio and watched the Food Channel and listened to music while going over the menu and having a great conversation with out out-of-country guests. The patio is a good place for kids because the patio can drown out even the loudest child.  If you have a need for food with a great bite to it, this is the spot. We only waited 20 minutes for a table for 8 at the peak dinner hour of 7-8. Our server was quick to greet us and get our drinks to our table. We ordered the sashimi wonton tacos and sausage cheese dip with pretzels wrapped with pepperoni. Tuna was fresh. Wontons not greasy. Wasabi sauce with enough zing but not enough to over power the tuna. Pretzels and cheese dip was nice and hot. Pretzels sprinkled with parmesan cheese and crisp.  Entree's were big enough to serve two people! Beef brisket, beef short ribs, pork ribs, Caesar salad, bacon cheese burger all packed with flavor. Caesar salad comes with a huge garlic crouton, which my daughter cut up and we used it to finish up the sausage cheese dip! Caesar dressing was fresh. Corn bread and macaroni & cheese sides tasty. Ordered the cheesecake for dessert. It was large enough for our party of 8 and we left some of it there. Asked our server to put the pretzels, fudge sauce and potato chips on the side instead of on top, which they did.   If your stomach is sensitive, you may want to ask for the various sauces on the side because this isn't a place to miss. It's not that the food is spicy, it does the dance of the happy on your tongue and in your tummy. For some people, it may be too much but for me, this is a good thing!"
"I was told so many great things about this place but my entire experience was awful. The food wasn't very good, way too greasy. My fries were luke warm and my tray was literally covered in grease. I needed about 50 napkins and a shower after that. The service was pretty awful too. I can't believe I paid $14 for a small meal with no extra fixings. On national cheeseburger day of all days too. Such a disappointment and I've never gone back since. Best thing about it was the soda, but that's pretty difficult to mess up."
"This place is quite possibly my favorite restaurant in Phoenix.   My favorites are the Chicken Scarpariello, the pizza and the Sangria. My wife can't decide between four dishes. Our daughter loves the Penne ala Vodka, Lasagna, or Ravioli.  Mario and his sons work hard to please and we've never had a bad meal here. I've seen them bend over backwards to try and take care of obvious jerks.   Plus to top it off, when local school invited local pizza places to present to a class on making pizza and recycling issues, Mario came and talked to the kids as if they were adults. All the other places treated it as a marketing event and brought coupons.   Get the idea? It's all good at this neighborhood gem!"
"Man, I love Toronto! Hiding in a strip mall on Overlea, find a dingy looking restaurant that serves up fantastic, cheap kabob...be warned regardless of when you come here you'll likely be waiting for a table as this place is always overrun with people...If you're a fan of perfectly grilled spicy meat, you must try this place out...now that I've been here I need to limit how many times I go here per month :)  Take the drive out and have some kabob...if you don't own a car, borrow one or get a zipcar membership...totally worth it!"
"Beer, beer, and more beer.  It's definitely a low-key nieghborhood bar.  As an out of towner, I enjoyed it.  It felt like Pittsburgh's version of Cheers except grimier.  Unfortunately, the kitchen closes fairly early on weekdays otherwise this place may have received another star."
"Love the crust on this pizza. The sauce is decent, cheese is okay, the pepperoni was not the best quality.  My friend ordered an everything slice, said it was good, just wished so cheese was on the toppings to hold it together."
"Normally, I give a restaurant at least 3 stars as long as it has good food. However, our group was quite disappointed with this restaurant. Granted, we were expecting a lot from an Italian restaurant in the Venetian, but I also think those are fine expectations to have when eating at these prices.  First, we changed our reservation, and they said they could accommodate the time. Clearly, they shouldn't have. We were seated at a folding table in the hallway next to the restaurant, quite literally in the food court next to a kiosk selling trinkets to tourists. Whatever ambiance this restaurant might offer is a mystery to me. They shouldn't have switched the reservation if it wasn't possible to accommodate the change (our fault, wouldn't blame them). I know they threw a table together as our table and chairs looked different from the rest of the ones set up. A few were just in front of the restaurant but not off to the side like ours was.  I expected to pay a lot in the Venetian, but I expected to be blown away. I would have preferred dining at several places we walked at on the way to this one. I paid $17 for spaghetti carbonara. It was very tasty, a well-balanced sauce with a decent amount of pancetta. However, I finished the whole thing. I can't finish an entree at Olive Garden for the same price. I also ate a few pieces of bread. One of my friends ordered a chicken kabob (who knows why that's sold at an Italian restaurant). It was one single kabob with perhaps 4-5 pieces of chicken and 4-5 vegetables on a bed of rice and it cost $25! Absolutely outrageous.   To top it off, we told the waiter we were celebrating a birthday. He said ok, so I expected we would receive a dessert, as is customary. We received nothing. Of course, our waiter didn't seem keen on giving us the time of day so I don't know why I expected him to remember a birthday."
"I'm not that familiar with Scottsdale so I'm just guessing that this restaurant is fairly new. The atmosphere is great and lively but s but loud. They have a huge wine and drink list.   The food was really good, I highly recommend the ahi tuna appetizer, ravioli and the skirt steak!"
"""Good morning, cocktails for you?""  Wait...what? Oh...it's Vegas!  Dining here, you best not be dieting because this place is literally the definition of excess, but in a good way. I'm a sucker for benedicts so that was awesome.  Service was really great too and the staff was so welcoming. It was our first stop just after landing so really appreciate the service.  Back in Hawaii this reminds me of Zippys or Anna Millers - that home feeling. Prices are a bit high, but for what you get it's totally worth it. Will remember this place if I ever return to Vegas in the future."
"Hands down best Bloody Mary ever. So many things in my BM, veggies  mmm bacon.  ""Nailed it"" it's an appetizer. I also had the burger with fries. Who knew fries could be so good. The presentation doesn't disappoint ether. Very nice. Great seating outside although we sat inside. Would love to see this restaurant near my hometown. Seriously. Get the BM. You rock Guy!"
Quiet bar and grill great waitress and the margarita pizza was very good. Small sign out front and almost missed the place.
"This is my first yelp.  This restaurant was soo good I felt compelled to yelp about it.  Went for dinner with a friend of mine, really nice space.  All the staff were amazing!!  The chef even came out to our table which was cool.  And the Food, well I think even the most discerning top chef judges would be impressed.  A++ across the board.  We had the tenderloin and mac and cheese.  As well as the tomatoes two ways both are excellent choices.  I can't wait to go back.  Cielo, kudos."
"Overall the food is really good. We had bruschetta and it seemed to have just a tad bit too much olive oil on it. Had it had anymore on it we would not have eaten it. My husband had chicken Parmesan and I ordered a salad with grilled salmon. He said his tasted good and my salon was cooked perfect. I also enjoyed whatever the dressing was, I just wish it would have been on the side. For whatever reason it was poured on and also came with a cup of it on the side. We agreed that the prices seemed a bit high for the experience. It has a similar feel to Bravo but service just isn't at that level yet (from our experience). Our sever did not know anything about the menu or what is fried in their fryers which should be expected at $18+ a plate. (We asked because of food allergies) She did however make sure to note allergies on our order which we appreciated! The music also did not match the setting. I really wanted to relax but the music was super up beat and almost had me rushing to leave. We will try again in a few months and I'll update my review then."
"I have no idea what the owner's problem is, but he's incredibly rude. His wife, on the other hand is super nice (an odd mix).  Great space, rude owner and the coffee is average."
"I used to work food service and my manager at the time recommended I try Defalco's. He knows food well so I was excited to try one of his favorites spots.  This place is really, really good. Lot of authentic Italian choices and they even have a grocery section with tons of legit Italian goodies. I had a Chicken Parmigiana sandwich that was to die for. Anytime my ex-manager comes back to town (he left for Vegas and I think he misses Defalco's more than anything else in the valley), he is sure to stop by and grab his favorite grub.  Parking is a bit tricky during busy hours and the wait times for food can get a bit long, so I recommend calling your order ahead of time (unless you want to take a look around while you wait, first-timers)."
"I really enjoyed coming here, it located near walnut st which meant parking was difficult.   What I didn't realized was that hot pots where individualized. They gave a pot over an electric hot plate which you can adjust the temp. They also have hot water on the side in case you run out. Very fulfilling for $15.  It's a small area and they also have a section for you to customize your own sauces."
"These darn Northerners really know how to make some goooood eggplant. I am obsessed, like seriously obsessed with their eggplant minced pork dish. it sounds so simple but never have I had it this good. Everything else on the menu is decent, the dumplings, XLB, noodles, etc., but the eggplant is to die for! Go for the authentic side of the menu avoid the Americanized dishes."
"the few times i ordered from here i was greatly disappointed. freezer burned strawberry ice cream, microwaved food and run of the mill breakfast."
Just ok. Not a fun true busy dim sum place and I'm so sure they don't make their own food. Won't be back soon.
"I've been coming to Loco on mill since they opened. I love coming here especially on Sundays for football. They have all the games on, great bloodys, and awesome breakfast!  Loco is my local watering hole and I always have a great time with the staff."
"Ordered combo 3.  It comes with two plates or rice (or bread), one skewer of chicken breast kebob, one skewer of koobideh, one skewer of barg kebob, 3 grilled tomatoes, a plate of parsley and sliced radish, a bunch of basil.  No salad.  The meat were all very flavourful, not dry and juicy!!! The taste was very good.   Definitely a lot of food for two people. :)  The waitress was very friendly and attentive.    I read another review that they do not accept amex, and yeah they really don't.  But I asked before I paid for the meal so it's ok."
"The decor and everything int he restaurant is really nice and sheik looking. We got the Resting Panda and the Whiskey sour, both of which were very tasting drinks. We started with the Foo Foo plater (just to be able to try a bit of everything). It was pretty good actually, I'd highly recommend it! Our server (i believe her name was Nicky) was super awesome and really nice and helpful. She decided on getting the pork belly ramen and two sushi rolls. The ramen was good, a little salty, but I'd recommend it. Then we received the Spider roll, which was great. Next up was the Crispy roll, which was where the problems arose. We had to wait over 45 minutes for one roll. After about half an hour they finally brought us a different roll to apologize for it taking so long. Apparently they didn't have the crispy rice prepped so that was what was taking so long. I myself am a server, and although the server came over and apologized several times, it probably would have been a good idea to have the manager come and apologize. We finally got it and it was okay, and they ended up comping it, which was nice. I'd give this place one more try...But I most limey wouldn't order the crispy rice roll again."
"Hey....i just want to say, everytime I eat here, since the late 90's.  Nothing but good wings, good beer, and good times.  If the waiting staff is terrible, slow, non attentive, so be it.  I eventually get my food and beer, im busy either catching up with friends or pull out the cell phone and chat with friends.  Weird but there it is.  Have Fun here..........Cheers!"
"While the prices are a bit high for a make-your-own pizza, the taste makes up for it. I love going to Seventh Street market, sitting Not Just Coffee and having a drink while waiting for delicious fresh made pizza from Pure.  I've taken this to go as well as eaten inside the market, and I can say that the pizza doesn't do well reheated. So try to eat it fresh while there if possible.  If one of their specialty pizzas sounds good to you, go for it, as those are definitely a better deal for the amount of toppings you get for the money.  I wanted what I wanted, though, so I ended up with a medium, thin crust, regular crust pizza with jalapenos, pepperoncini, onions and feta.  It was pretty expensive at $2/topping = $20 med pizza. But it was delicious.  The arugula salad with goat cheese and lemon vinaigrette is to-die-for. I crave that dressing days later. So light and fresh but flavorful."
"Visited this restaurant after a 3 hour drive to get to it.  We, my boyfriend and I,  saw their ad on their website for an $$85 per couple Valentine's Day Dinner.  We had reservations for 6p.m. this reservation was made on Friday, we dined on Saturday. When we arrived right at 6p.m. there were plenty of OPEN tables in the restaurant.  When the hostess looked for our name on the reservation list it showed we were to be sat at table 14.  The list said in large print at the top..DO NOT CHANGE TABLES.  The hostess walked us past 8 - 10 2 person tables to sit us at a 2 person table literally 6inches from the neighboring table!  Could we have asked to sit elsewhere? Apparently not as the hostess was under direct orders not to change tables.  Could we have dined elsewhere...probably not considering it is Valentines Weekend and we drove 3 hours to get there and have no reservations any where else, and no idea at 6p.m. where to go.    So we sat.  We could hear EVERY WORD the table next to us said. (Which by the way when you take your pregnant wife out for Valentine's Day you probably shouldn't answer the phone when your buddies call or talk about how ""hot"" her female coworker is.)  This was so awkward, you had to watch every word you said to be sure the neighboring diners weren't eavesdropping on personal info. Most uncomfortable ""romantic"" evening of my life...  Now to the food.  The Valentine's Day meal was a choice of appetizer to share (except for one - they sold out the night before), a ""salad"", choice of any appetizer on the menu (again except for the New Zealand Rack of Lamb, because it too sold out the night before.), a Chocolate Creme Brulet to share for dessert, and a bottle of Nero D'Avola (which we were told is a $35 bottle of wine). We ordered two bowls of soup to go along with the special.   The soup - Lobster Bisque (Delicious) and Minestrone with sausage ( missing the sausage and the vegetable were literally giant sized. It was like eating a salad with broth and rice in it). However it did taste quite nice.  The appetizer - Artichokes with Prosciutto.. YUMMO!  The salad - hmm not what I had in mind. A tiny plate of Feta Cheese, cucumber, pear in balsamic vinegar and gosh knows what else...but NOT a traditional salad..So beware!  Taste was great, but if you are expecting a bowl of leafy greens and some toppings...This it is not.  The meal - Veal with shrimp and gnocchi..Quite pleasing to the palette.  The dessert - Chocolate Creme Brulet...   Umm not so much..it was quite clearly 3/4 cup of Chocolate Mousse with a sliced strawberry on top and a store bought sugar cookie in the shape of a heart.  Yes it did taste good, however...where was the Creme Brulet the waiter raved about?  The wine - Nero D'Avola...yes I am a red wine drinker, the wine was delicious.  But upon looking it up when we returned to the hotel room...found it only sold for $10 - $13 a bottle...Why the lie? We would have ordered the special anyway...  The atmosphere...beautiful, romantic (if you like sharing intimate moments with strangers) but it was pleasantly dark with candles and Christmas lights through out. They had an electric fireplace when we first sat down we observed and enjoyed the heat coming from it, since as you know we dress up, not dress warm when going out to dinner. The place lost half of its power 5 minutes after sitting down. The manager  chose to turn the fireplace off, even though it stayed lit and running during the power outage.  By the time I left, my toes were frozen.  We finished eating and paid for the bill at 7:50p.m. I turned around and noticed FOUR empty 2 person tables. They had never been sat, but we had to sit with an unfamiliar couple!   Upon leaving the hostess who was so sweet and friendly upon arrival was short and sarcastic in her good bye and have a nice evening.  Would I go back when in town again? No.  At the risk of being sat in that situation again.  The food can be the most delicious in the world, but I still prefer and deserve privacy when dining.  And to the lady we sat next to...Good luck on your birth, maybe your dislike for cheese will go away after you give birth."
"Not sure why some posted negative reviews of this place because it is on point. My girlfriend and I had dinner there last night, with reservations set for 6 p.m., were seated by 6:05. Our server William was awesome, was fast, attentative and really was one of the best servers we've encountered and we dine out a lot. We both ordered all you can eat crab legs and they were fresh, hot and delicious. I do feel the sticker price was high but we must have had 5 buckets each so it equates to 10 bucks a pound.   The only negative I did feel could be addressed is the tables are made of some type of epoxy resin so being outside, May be melting or something because there was a sticky residue on the table top. I just played a napkin over it so it was acceptable.   My girlfriend and I will definitely be returning to pickle bills, we had a fantastic evening. Last thing to note, the service was great even though the place was packed!"
After being a HUGE fan of the Mission I decided to try this place out seeing that it's owned by the same owners even though I was very skeptical that it could possibly be as great. To my surprise it lived up to what others had told me. The ambiance was amazing. Very much like the mission. Candles light up the entire place. The outside patio is quite large and there is a lot of seating available. The staff was great and very helpful with making suggestions on the menu. My favorite items on the menu are the scallops and the Apple caramel upside down cake. They were cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth. They have a great wine list and its a perfect setting to enjoy a few glasses of wine:) This is a great date night spot that I recommend it now to all my friends.
Best Thai food ever! Love the mango curry especially and everything. They have great bubble tea too. Very nice service very polite.
What an awesome pool party!!! I wish there was a tad more interactive aspects. I want hot girls and guys spraying champagne all over us or dancing with us.
"I love Pizza, but I try to stay away for dietary reasons. I went here last week with my daughter and mom, and was pleasantly surprised. Thin crust New York style pizza at a good price. The menu is kind of simple, but that's the way these places are nowadays. Friendly staff and clean simple surroundings."
Was very excited for happy hour and heard great things. Food was less then average we were charged $10 for BREAD.  Most apps were greasy or fried and still spent $250 on happy hour menu for a group of 4. First review on yelp so cared enough to take the time to write this. Sorry won't come back.
"My family and I came in on Wed. Night for dinner we had a party of 6 plus a baby(using a high chair). We had to wait about 10 mins to be seated and when we got to our table it was against the wall, half booth half chairs. My husband asked to sit at another table but the hostess said ""No"" so we had the baby between our table and the customers next to us, luckily she's a great baby!! The table and booth were dirty and floor was sticky, gross, and I had to kick a fork out from under my seat. The service was subpar but the waiter was nice. It took 20 mins for my boys to get their drinks and refills, well they were sparse to say the least. I ordered steamed broccoli which was actually raw when it came out the first time but they, what I believe, microwaved it to warm it up. My poor daughter in law had a charcoal patty which she sent back and it took a good 25-30 mins to be replaced. The worse part is my son has a sensitivity to gluten so he ordered a gluten free bun but they gave him a Ciabatta bun which he didn't realize until he had already eaten half the burger. My husband brought the issues up to the manager but she didn't really contribute anything to the situation other than sending the burnt burger back. The waiter's solution for the inconvenience was a free appetizer card to be redeemed the next time they came in. We live 3 1/2 hours from Mesa and it's so disappointing to run into this kind of service, this was definitely not a pleasant experience"
"Five stars! I highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for authentic Latin American cuisine. Coming from someone raised in Latin America, I'm usually skeptical of restaurants that claim to have Latin American food because although the dishes try to imitate Latin American styles, they usually come up short and completely miss the subtle flavors that make these dishes what they're supposed to be. However, Chica completely nailed it. The whole chicken with chimichurri is a must-have (we shared it among four people) and the small dishes were delicious as well. The mini arepas that came with the guacamole were a really nice surprise and the empanadas were simply amazing and tasted just like the ones back home. Besides that, the latin music was on point and the cocktails were great too!"
"Oooh momma! The flavor is strong with this one. Clean, fast, friendly everytime. But not weird and sterile like Baja Fresh. Glad they're open again!"
Oh. My. Gosh. I'm not going to write much except that it was DELICIOUS. I came here because of all the reviews and seriously it was worth the drive. I had the spring rolls and those were delicious. Then I had the noodle ye-saw with shrimp. And I pretty much licked my plate. And all the plates going by looked better and better. I'm already planning the next time I come here. And my server was a sweet sweet girl. Soft spoken but just the perfect server. I'd take a picture of my food but I dove in and cleaned my plate. Lol. Oh well. There are 254 pics for you to choose from.
"Fresh food, tasty, and amazing service are the 3 characteristics that come to my mind when thinking about this place. However price is a big downside. Went there on a Tuesday night, did not have to wait for a table and service was quick and the staff was very friendly. The menu options are pretty limited but definitely focused on providing the most typical Portuguese experience.  One major downside: the food portions are extremely small for the price you pay. The value for money clearly isn't fair considering they are dishes tapas style. In a regular restaurant you'd get real size dishes for the price you pay for tapas there.  2 mini starters, 2 entrees (tapas style) shared + 1 desert with one glass of wine gave us a $90 bill and we left without feeling full. The desert was a caramel fondant with pear ice cream, probably the only thing we ate that was so incredible we would have paid twice the price for. Otherwise it was too pricy. I will definitely go back once they revise their price!"
"Amazing place, full of authentic decor and ambiance! Papaya salad is so refreshing and full of flavor. Combination pad thai with pork beef and shrimp is enough for two meals.  Thai toasts for an appetizer consists if minced chicken and shrimp baked on toast served with cucumber salad. It us a must try!!"
"I'm not that pleased with this experience. For the price, I expected better ambiance and better presentation. The steaks were seasoned and cooked well. Our family enjoys a good cut that's perfectly done to each person's speculations. Also the service was perfect. Our server was thoughtful and attentive, without overly interrupting when we didn't need anything. However, for the high price of everything (not just the steaks) on the menu, we would've expected the place to feel more exclusive, more fancy, not so loud. It felt like a nice bar rather than a fine dining establishment. We had to shout over the noise and the place wasn't even totally full (Sunday evening). The plates were also nothing special to look at. Again because of the price, we expected a few frills. The meat and separate sides came out just plainly put onto plates. No effort was put into the presentation. Even casual restaurants throw some greens or garnishes on the dish for a little extra aesthetic. Probably won't return. If I'm paying this much, I'd like to feel a little more pampered."
"I work at Wells Fargo right next door to rubio's on 24th st and baseline and out main goal is too satisfy the customers using our vision and values. That being said rubios is so relative because everyday I go to rubios for lunch they make me feel at home and like a valued customer by showing quality service and going over and beyond the standard for me! They don't sale chimichangas but the manager George and the great cooks took it upon themselves to fry my burrito for me! George is a great leader and represents that franchise at a high level! Last but not least Priscilla the shift leader, lights up the whole room with her smile as soon as you are opening the door, as well delivering excellent service! Thanks rubios - DA'QUON  #YOURBANKTELLER"
I've been here 2x wasn't impressed the first time figured give them a second try. There latte doesn't impress me I'd rather goto the Starbucks adjacent to this spot
"I love this place. Lots of great, healthy options. Excellent variety, friendly staff, no exorbitant prices. Doesn't beat being held by someone who cares about you, but what does? Enough melancholy from me...go forth and eat healthy"
"They specialize in Southern California-style food like burritos, salsas and fish tacos. The decor and ambiance is great. The tables and bar stools, exposed-brick wall, modern light fixtures etc. make for a classy and comfortable dining experience. I saw a few craft beers and a respectable bourbon list. However, we did an early Saturday morning breakfast, which was fantastic. The banana pancakes were unreal."
I normally stop here for breakfast when travelling through calgary international airport. It is one of the few restaurants available once you pass security. Fare is ok for a decent breakfast and good coffee.  15 dollars for breakfast
The 5 for 6 'til 7 is so awesome and such a great deal! I wasn't sure the first time we went if we should dress up or if it was okay to wear jeans and a nice top but everyone was either in their business casual work clothes or jeans. I would recommend getting there a little early because it fills up quickly! We got there at 6pm and by 7pm it was pretty full.  I have recommended this to so many of my co-workers and friends to try out and so far anyone that has gone has come back to me saying what a great time they had and how surprised they were with the 5 for 6 'til 7 deal :)
"The only reason I'm even giving this place 2 stars is because of their food and drinks. Their service however, is probably the WORST I've ever had. I used to (emphasis on the tense) go there every Tuesday for trivia night (the guy hosting is awesome). My service has been absolutely horrible every time except for once when a girl named Jess waited on us. The rest of the waitresses are completely incompetent and utterly rude off the bat.   When we began ordering appetizers the waitress stopped us and asked if this was ""going to be complicated or not."" She then forgot to put in an order for 1 of 3 appetizers ordered. It took about 15 mins after getting 2 of them, to even bring that to her attention, for which she didn't even apologize. After 35mins and someone else bringing our food out, we finally had to go to the bar and ask someone to come take our drink orders, a task that was also messed up (I ordered their special of Big ass margeritas to which I received a small mason jar of mostly ice). They told me it'd be free, but it honestly wasn't even worth that. After that, the only time I saw our waitress was when she was visibly talking about us and pointing with another waitress. Completely unprofessional. A different waitress had to bring us our checks and messed that up too.   I had this same waitress the Tuesday before accompanied by the same crummy service. That's when I realized that it wasn't just a bad or busy night (it was a Tuesday for crying out loud), but that this woman is just REALLY bad at customer service. Definitely do NOT recommend going there!!! Don't know exactly which was our original waitress but our checks said Joanne G.   Will also be posting my experience on your Facebook in hopes that you get better trained and caring staff."
"I've been here a couple of times by recommendation from a Korean friend. The Jjamppong and Jjajangmyun are very delicious. It's even better when they're cheaper on the special menu days (rotates every other day). The portions are very generous. I usually share 1 dish with my friend. It's $5.00 (Jjajangmyun - Tues,Thurs, Sat, Sun) and $6.99 (jjamppong - mon, wed, fri).  However, I was a bit surprised at their dish with the steamed buns (I think it's Kochu Japchae)... it was super pricey!!! That dish alone was $20.99 on the special... very little meat, mostly peppers and some other veggies. I'm guessing the expensive part was the steamed buns... 'cause those looked really intricately made.  I think there are actually several pricey dishes they serve on their menu. I'll just stick to the affordable menu items.  In general, I really like their dishes (jjamppong and jjajangmyun), and their service is friendly, but I don't think I can come here without my Korean friend. It seems like the servers don't speak English, and there is no translated menu..."
Also don't believe when they say they will give you a credit for unsatisfactory meal because for some reason they have a tendency to forget they said it.  They no longer have to worry about my business.
We stopped by for a little shopping. The mall is nicer than most and has plenty of stores. It was a nice way to spend a few hours before heading on to another adventure.
"I hope that every person who follows me, everyone I know and anyone contemplating this establishment reads this first and NEVER bothers to give this place with the crappiest staff of all time a second thought. Earlier today my friend and I dropped in to grab some lunch.. the staff either all lost their dogs this morning, or just have the absolute worst attitudes you've ever seen in human beings. Not only was the nasty woman who served me avoiding any type of pleasantry but she was yelling across two other workers and a line of patrons asking what I wanted from the other end of the shop. When I asked the server for lettuce, onion and roasted red peppers on my sandwich she quite literally moaned very loud and followed it with yelling ""ughhhhh god help me!"" Before adding my toppings to my turkey sandwich. When one of the other servers asked us if our food was for ""here or to go"" the original server says aloudly ""to-go hopefully!!!"" Wtf... I'd love to know who this terrible human being thinks she is! I found my jaw on the floor more than once, wondered why she thought I was such a headache, and my friend and I decided right there that we would NEVER return nor would we let this review go untold to everyone we know!! I feel the owners somehow have to be to blame! How the hell do you allow someone so miserable represent your livelihood? You don't expect livelihood for very much longer, that's how.  Ps... maybe this server will look a little less ""I just woke up"" at her next job."
"Cafe Maya, the newest coffee shop in this location. Not too much has changed, although the inside seems a bit more spacious and cozy. They offer all of your typical coffee drinks and prices are reasonable. They have a couch and a large chair as well as around 10 wooden tables with chairs. They offer a food menu for breakfast and lunch, but not dinner. They also have a rewards punch card for loyal customers. This place is usually pretty quiet and chill and not too busy, so a good place to go for some casual studying. There is no parking lot, so you have to hope to find a street parking spot available nearby which is the main limitation if you are driving. Overall a nice little coffee shop."
"Unbelievable experience start to finish.  We had a reservation for 9pm Saturday. When we arrived our table wasn't ready yet but the host asked if we wanted drinks and took our drink orders. There is no drink menu here - the staff is the drink menu- which was nice. Everyone is very knowledgeable and quick with recommendations.  Our party was big so we were seated outside on the patio which was enclosed and heated.  The menu changes a lot apparently and there is also a pretty big specials menu. For apps we got oysters, a sea urchin (from the specials menu), the foie gras terrine (from the specials menu), and the veal tartare. Everything was incredible and pairings were perfect. For example the bread that came with the foie gras was completely different than the toast served with the veal tartare which was completely different than the bread we were served with butter and pickles while we were waiting for our starters.  For dinner everyone got the lobster spaghetti. The portion was way big enough for two after apps and it was incredibly rich between the sauce, bacon and huge lobster chunks. Each order of the pasta comes with half a lobster.  Every wine pairing we tried was amazing.  Unfortunately we had no room for dessert but the meal was definitely above out expectations.   Expect to be here for a while. Our reservation was at 9 and we only finished eating at 11:37- and we're not slow eaters. I think the wait had to do with our party being big and the rest of the place being packed"
Wild every night! My favorite place hands-down in AZ! The night life here is contagious and Iv never been disappointed with there Sunday fun day! Every Sunday they have a corn hole competition and crazy drink specials like penny refills!! You also have to try there duck and pork tacos or there Hefe Hamburger! My favorite margarita on the menu is the la chica flaca. If you want a fun place to get lunch and a few drinks or looking to go crazy night this is the spot.
"The reason that I'm giving Scallywags 3 stars isn't for the food, it's for the fact that this is what it is: A drinking hole that shows the games on the telly & not for a meal.   We went to see England play in the Euro 2012 and it was fun! Everyone was totally into it.   **this place is to have a beer & watch the game not for eating**"
"Service was amazing, Christina was extremely tentative and took care of our whole group. Asked about splitting checks from the beginning which for a large group is very convenient!"
"My family and I have been visiting this location since it opened. Can't really remember the year now.   Although several of the reviews have to do with bad customer service, I have found that it's definitely a staff turnaround issue. We go often during the summers, and well, all year round actually. LoL. It's never too cold to get ice cream in AZ, am I RIGHT?????  Anywho, the ice cream is always yummy and the experience of the kids being able to run back and forth AND BACK AND FORTH trying new flavors or deciding which one to pick It's always fun!    Sadly, the smiling faces might not always be there, but thankfully, we always have a smile on OUR FACE that transfers to them weather the staff likes it or not. LoL"
"You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both and there you have the facts of life... at Fieramosca.  (You are old like me if you know that theme song!)  Have you ever gone to a restaurant with great expectations based on reviews and left disappointed?  That was our experience.  Some call it cozy but for me the table layout in the main dining room is claustrophobically cramped.  If you want a seat on the patio on Friday or Saturday in the summer, make sure to reserve several days in advance.  Reservations are taken by phone and I will admit they were very helpful even if it did take 10 rings for them to answer... I was surprised that a restaurant in this price range did not have online reservations!  Being in a house transformed into a restaurant, the entry hallway is narrow, so if someone is going out, nobody can go in and vice versa.    So if you are even a little claustrophobic,  be warned, you won't be comfortable here.    The food:  Complimentary bruschetta:  A plain Pizza crust with bruschetta topping which falls off and wasn't that flavourful. Go to La Bruschetta to find out how it is meant to taste.  Caesar salad:  Crispy romaine, hints of fresh garlic and Parmesan but the dressing seemed watery and the croutons were like rocks.  Bread basket:  Now I know why the croutons are like rocks, the crust on the bread was so hard I was worried I would break a tooth, and I also found it strange to be served whole wheat bread, when I was expecting crusty Italian bread.    Spaghetti Carbonara:   The reason we came was because Hubby was craving Carbonara and based on great reviews we thought we would try it here but he found Fieramosca's version disappointingly bland, even with extra Parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper.    Linguini DI Mamma Ninetta:  I love mushrooms but was surprised that there were so many in this dish... With just 3 small shrimp and a few small pieces of chicken scattered throughout, and very little garlic flavour, this dish was edible but far from great.  Tiramisu:  No coffee flavour!  I have made Tiramisu before and have had it in countless restaurants and I know the lady fingers are to be dipped in coffee before being covered in cream, and these missed the coffee altogether, and the cream here seemed to just be whipped cream, none of the yummy marscapone that I was expecting.   Libretto's Tiramisu in a jar might not be traditional in presentation but has all the flavour that Fieramosca's lacked.  My favourite dessert when done well, I left disappointed.  Lemon Sorbet:  Frozen sorbet in a scooped out lemon, menu says imported from Italy.  I actually liked it better than the sad face Tiramisu so hubby swapped with me because while he usually loves anything lemon, he found an odd aftertaste.  I joked it was the jet fumes to bring frozen sorbet from Italy but the truth is, it was the perfume worn by the woman at the table next to ours.  Thankfully she arrived as we had dessert, so our entire meal was not ruined, but the smell was so overpowering that it gave us both a headache and we wanted to get out of there fast, since with the cramped layout she was almost on top of our table.  Ladies, please don't drown yourself in perfume and go to a restaurant!  Ugh!  TL;DR - Meh. Bottom line nothing was horrible but nothing was great, which for the price was disappointing.  Not worth a second visit.  2 stars bumped to 3 because the service was good.  The search for Pasta Carbonara continues... maybe a trip to NYC or even Rome!"
"Great environment, I loved their meat jun. Very flavorful. Also they give side dishes which is definitely a bonus"
"I don't normally say things are the best but these are the best fajitas I've ever had. Chips are perfect ,salsa is perfect, bean dip is perfect, and the best fried ice cream I've ever had. Plus the service is great."
Definitely a spot to check out when looking for a quality sandwich at a reasonable price.  The shop staff are very friendly and more than willing to accommodate any request.   Do yourself a favor and get one of the steak sandwiches off of the menu. They are amazing. The ultra is my favorite.  Also the Cancun fries are awesome. 1 order is for sue big enough to serve 2 people maybe even 3!   This is one of the Peppis that takes credit cards as well. Not all do FYI
"I had THE BEST VEGAN Gardein chicken plate with broccolini. I was blown away!!! The decor is cute! Nicely dimly lit, It was romantic and very chic. I recommend coming if you're a vegan looking for a good dinner!"
"I've dined here a few times with my family and we keep coming back, despite a few misses.  I really want to be a fan of this place though. The red salsa is good and hot while the green satisfies the less adventurous.  The guacamole (made to your specs at the table) is delicious and its pretty much all my 4 year old eats there.  I normally get the tacos, either brisket or fish and they're really great, though I'm not a fan of mango salsas in general.   Last night we had the guac and a couple of Wednesday special margaritas which were just right.  We thought the chips tasted a little stale though and the small bowl, coupled with distracted waitstaff, became empty quickly. My wife and I split the main dish, which was a special ""baked brisket enchilada"" recommended by the waitress.  It was huge and definitely more than enough for too, but we didn't care for it. There didn't seem to be much beef in it; it was mostly sauce and cheese.  It will be awhile before we go again, and I think we'll stick to the tacos when we do. In summary, lots to like here, but I'd say stick to the basics."
Well this was the first time trying this place since they just opened not long ago. We wanted to try something different so we ordered the half sub and soup special. I thought it was expensive if you ask me. It was like $9. So it was over $20 with 2 specials and a drink. It didn't even fill you up for that kind of money! The soup comes in a small container and the sub is very small for being a half. Very disappointed in how much came on the sub. They make them with their back to you and you can not see the items they put on and they don't even ask what you want on it. They just proceed to make it the way they want. I can honestly say you get so much more for your money at Subway for much less and you can make the sub the way you want and you get very full and sometimes even have leftovers! The soup was hot and had a good flavor but such a small container and they fill just above half. We didn't get much at all. Over all not our favorite sub place. Not happy. Not sure if we would go back here.
"I love coming to pastel ! My favorite items are the black sesame crepe and the green tea crepe. Their waffles are good too, but I personally like crepes more. The ice cream and whipped cream is not too sweet which I like. I recently tried their matcha batter crepe, it wasn't bad, but I prefer sticking to plain crepes with green tea or black sesame ice cream.  I think pastel is a great dessert spot after having dinner around the area. The outdoor seating also makes it a perfect date spot in the summer."
"Seeing ""Chicago"" in the name of a taco shop gave me a little pause, but the food and employees are both 5 stars.   The Asada fries were awesome! The meat was well seasoned and had that perfect grilled crunch that I love. You can choose nacho cheese or cheddar,  I chose the cheddar, and they put a good portion on.  It's topped with Pico,  sour cream   and a huge scoop of fresh guac. Lovely dish!  I also had a pastor taco, which is just like a traditional street taco you would find elsewhere.  The pastor was perfectly seasoned and had the same crunch from being grilled.   Overall a great experience: Food was great and the staff was very friendly.  The owner came to the table to  ask how the food was and we talked for a few minutes. He was genuinely interested in feedback and his passion for cooking and providing a great experience for his customers was very evident.  I recommend everyone stop in and give this place a try.  It is now on my list of regular lunch spots when I am on the N. Side."
"What a cute place! I was visiting relatives in the area and we went here to grab coffee and breakfast. The egg sandwich I got on a bagel was HUGE and tasty, but it was pretty greasy. The coffee is really good and the service is fast and friendly. I recommend it!"
"Went to Vegas again Memorial Day Weekend but this time with my girlfriends so wanted them to try this place since LOVED it so much when I came with hubby.  This time tried the Angry Dog and just as amazingly deelish!!!  Friends got Chili (homemade by Buldogis) Dog, Bulgogi Bowl, Fries, and again the Euro Fries with kimchee added and they LOVED it too!   My 2 friends who had the Chili Dog said the chili was very good! One of them is not even a hotdog fan and loved it :)  IF you are EVER in Vegas THIS is a MUST!!!"
"Good environment, I ordered the famous meatloaf and it is large but a little bit salty. The waitress is not that friendly but overall I had a great experience."
"Love this place!! Delicious! I just wish it was closer to my house. Other than that, I have no complaints. The price point is reasonable and the menu selection is great. Couldn't ask for anything else!"
"Food taste Ok. I like the pasta selection. However, there is No seafood choices at all. If you are looking for seafood, skip this place."
"Perfect Grilled Cheese was amazing and worth a repeat  visit.  Chicken club lacked unique flavor and was average.  The BLT was great with the bread making the sandwiches.  Now for the sides: tomato soup was delicious and a perfect complement to the grilled cheese.  Shoe string fries were great, nothing not to like about them and the green pea salad in peanut sauce was delicious.  We will definitely return for another try!"
Good fresh and home cooked food. Loved breakfast especially biscuits and gravy Small quaint place that does get busy. Decent pricing.
"I love this place and have been using it for three years now but I have to knock it down by one star because at times, not often, but it happens, we'll get our normal stuff and it will be nothing like we're used to getting from them.  Usually they are excellent, however, a couple of times now it has also been greasy, tasteless and overcooked to a point where someone should really have noticed it on sight before it ever left the kitchen.  It's disappointing when that happens, then wish you didn't bother."
"As soon as I parked my car, this rude elderly lady comes out saying these parking spaces are reserved...I UNDERSTAND AND CAN READ THAT ON YOUR SIGN lady.  Just because my other family members are dinning at Hong Kong Garden for Dim Sum does not automatically mean that EVERYONE is looking to eat there.  I was and had a craving for deli sandwiches in which I did ended up walking in to purchase 2 as planned (receipt still in hand).  Don't go around assuming and start off with horrible service.  I ended up keeping my car parked there the WHOLE afternoon taking a space just because that lady was rude.   ***Also would be nice to offer water for your customer that is waiting for his to-go order***"
"We lived in Mexico for several years so are always looking for authentic restaurants. La taquizza does a good job.  Their menu is diverse and includes many of our favourite dishes you don't typically find in Canada.  The food is much better in house than as take out.  We have ordered many dishes off the menu and love anything carnitas and the fact that they have decent corn tortillas. The huraches are great too. I am a bit biased about the tacos al pastor since I lived in Puebla, but they are still ok. Can't miss the mandatory churros though. They are amazing!"
"This was a fun experience.. although sitting in the dark gets old pretty quickly.  I expected that the food was going to be amazing but it was just ok, nothing fabulous.   For the price we paid I expected higher end cuisine. They say you eat with your eyes and I now wonder if not having the visual of the food was part of the food tasting a bit bland for me!?! It's an interesting experience to eat in complete darkness wondering what the room looks like or what your food looks like. At some point most people end up eating with their hands. (You can't see where or what's on your plate)."
"I am so blown away by this sophisticated & beautiful hotel. One of the best in Las Vegas. The decor is breathe taking, and this place always smell like a magical garden. With so many top notch restaurants, spa services, shows, and clubs to choose from. It's vegas luxury! The last time I stayed here, July 2011, it was such a BIG disappointment. There was a total of 8 of us. One of the bed broke and fell flat to the floor (no, there were no foul play)! 6 out 8 of us left with some kind of bug bite that looks like a terrible case of eczema/rash! The mechanic curtain didn't work. The main T.V. didn't work. Actually, disappointed is an understatement, WE WERE DISGUSTED! How can this 5star resort & hotel failed us so miserably!!!!!?   (please view pictures of rash)"
"The brussel sprout nachos are really as good as the other reviewers have mentioned! I've had them more then a few times and everyone always loves them, be careful because they can easily fill you up! Individual tacos and the burritos are great too. I've also had a few of their salads and love them, big a portion sizes. Great classic margarita as well, love this place for groups esp on Sunday when is all day happy hour!"
"Really underwhelming flash brewed plastic spigot stored coffee, coffee ""menu"" consists of different syrup and coffee concoctions rather than regional or single origin blends or even fresh roasted beans. The red eye was okay, certainly nothing special, but drinkable. Once witnessed management screaming at kids over phone, weird experience as a patron of a business."
"Gluten free options promised, so we tried a turkey sandwich with avocado.   Large portion--very delicious.  5 choices of iced tea blends(free refills) and coffee choices made for a perfect girls' afternoon. Lots of seating outside on the covered patio.  Their parking fills quickly, but plenty of options on street or at the Municipal Bldg."
"We had a great lunch experience today at Rubios. It didn't start out that way but was quickly turned while we were checking out since we were using promotions.  We used the Yelp check in offer for a free entree with the purchase of a drink which is an awesome way to try something new. It was also ocean day insulated bag day which is really nice and will be used when grocery shopping this summer or transporting hot food to keep it warm.   We had a chimicurri steak burrito with chips as well as a cabo platter which is a burrito and taco. The steak burrito was really good because of the chimicurri sauce which had a refreshing and light taste. The shrimp burrito that came with the platter wasn't as good as it was heavier on the rice and beans so it didn't feel like it had enough shrimp but the taco made up for it. The drinks they have are different and refreshing too, I had a pomegranate lemonade by odowalla that uses real sugar instead of corn sryup.   I really recommend going to Rubios for a lighter refreshing meal, try the fish tacos and sign up for their club for emails on special offers."
"So I've been coming here for years and have never had any issues until today. I ordered what I've always ordered. A bean burrito, a taco and a drink. It cost over $9 dollars!! The lady didn't tell me a price in the drive through which is annoying because they don't have a screen that tells you. She asked if I wanted a bean and cheese burrito. Well obviously I said yes I want cheese in it. The price on the menu said it was like $2.50. There was no mention of cheese in my burrito costing more. So I pull up to the window and she tells me it will be $9.40 or whatever. I said, I'm sorry how much?? So I'm sitting there doing my own math and it still didn't add up. $2.09 for a drink, $2 something for the taco and $2 something for the burrito. Even with tax there was absolutely no way that it would have added up to that much. So I get the receipt and they charged me $4.58 for a burrito!! There sign said $2 something. I pulled around and went in and their price inside said $3 something for the burrito. I went up and asked why I was overcharged $4.58 for a burrito. He said because I got cheese in it. I said, your burritos don't come with cheese in them??? They always have and I've never been charged extra for it!! What place doesn't put cheese in a burrito?? Also, for the first time their taco was bad. I opened the box and the taco shell was wet and soggy!! Usually it's nice and crispy/crunchy and this time was not. I told them their signs are wrong. Also that it's ridiculous you charge that much for a burrito with cheese!! Told them I will never be back!! I can get better food at Taco Bell and more food for the same price!! They don't false advertise there either! Furious!  Their food and prices have gone downhill fast! They lost mine and my family's business for good!!"
"Came to this place based on yelp reviews and it did not disappoint. Got the chicken wings to start, kao soi with chicken and an dish from the chefs special - Steamed fish coconut curry. Chicken wings were good, especially when hot, the sauce gelatinized as it cooled. Kao soi was the best I've ever had, an excellent portion ans the chicken was very tender. The the fish coconut curry was good too, wasn't much of a curry but was still very flavourful. Service was fast and people were so friendly and kind. Will definitely go back to try other menu items."
"Great food in a homely Mexican setting. The tomato soup was amazingly delicious and their chicken dishes are great. Close to the intersection of College & Yonge, this is one of the few non-fast food Mexican restaurants in the Village area.  If you're searching for a non-commercial dining experience with homemade dishes, this is the place to come."
Don't let the location or the look of the building fool you. When I tell you this is THE BEST PLACE FOR AUTHENTIC MEXICAN EATS! I cannot stop eating their taco gringos Omg so yummy and everything is cooked to order right in front of you. This is the only place that can compare to the Hispanic food in California! You have to try it! DEFINITELY DESERVES MORE THAN 5 stars!!!!
We love the all you can eat king crab legs on Tuesdays. Service is good. The food is good. I enjoy the quick soup and salad for lunch.
"Go. Seriously. You will not be disappointed one bit!  We were craving breakfast food and decided to check this place out. We shared a skillet and a few breakfast sides, each of which were cooked to perfection and super tasty. The atmosphere here is cute, clean, and just what you want for enjoying your breakfast.   What really made our day being here was our awesome server, Tina. She was so cool, upbeat, easy to talk with, and was the most accommodating server you could ever hope to have. We plan on returning for more good eats and to see Tina again. :)"
"We had the curry it was really good but it was small portion for it's price.. the garlic chicken wasn't satisfying since it was dry, no spices, very plain and the chicken was kinda hard. Presentation was ok, you gotta order the rice seperate.. the service was fine the servers were pretty casual with their guests. Would come back for curry but not for tandoori or kabob."
So based on food alone they would have 3 stars but thats just not the case..arrived just after 5pm..they had a private party going on but they looked to be well taken care of and winding down...after placing our order we got our drinks and found a table...went back to wait for our food and was told they will bring it out to us...after 15 minutes and watching someone who ordered after us receive their food i went back up to the desk. ..and watched as our food sat on the counter and for another 5 minutes before they finally brought it out...and they didn't have our full order..it took the food runner 3 separate trips..heres a run down of our order Pulled chicken..not actually pulled but diced and dry Turkey..very good moist and tender  Pulled pork..very good..lot of flavor Mac and cheese..not the best but not the worst Greenbeens..good..the only hot side we got Banana bread pudding..full of butter but not horrible Overall food was 3 stars service was 1
"Not the best part of town.  Not particularly good (or particularly bad) service.  Even the food isn't the best.  But the variety is awesome, and unlike many places, everything is pretty good.  Some places have a good dish or two, but the rest stinks.  Not the China King.  It's all just solid food.  And not just Chinese either - pizza and even macaroni and cheese can be found, along with a huge salad bar, dessert bar and real ice cream (not a soft serve machine)."
"Hank's definitely stays on my list of places that wow me. Great atmosphere from the bar area with live music, to the great booth in the dining room with all the hustle and bustle of the staff creating that fine dining experience.  We felt very comfortable and well taken care of. Even had the manager share a bottle of wine with us! A memorable evening."
"My husband and I used to order from here more than I'd like to admit (almost weekly). The pizza is pretty mediocre, but it's really cheap and convenient. The cheesy bread, subs, chicken fingers, and onion rings are pretty delicious. We always order online (which I love), it's right around the corner, delivery is always under 45 minutes (yes, we're that lazy and really hate winter), and the delivery people are always super nice. Sadly, they had to go and screw up the good thing we had going.   Last time we ordered it was for pick-up as 20 years of junk food ordering has taught me pick-up to takes half the time of delivery. We ordered cheesy bread, a Philly sub, and onion rings. I asked for ranch instead of marinara with the cheesy bread and requested ranch for the onion rings.  I paid in advance and added a 20% tip (on take-out) thinking that would help make up for any ""inconvenience"" or cost of my ranch requests (we ordered the exact same thing for delivery the previous time with absolutely no problem, by the way). My husband showed up about 20 minutes after I ordered. Not only wasn't the food ready, but apparently they hadn't even started it and were in no hurry. He waited almost another HOUR (seriously--from ordering til he got home was an hour fifteen and it's about a one minute drive) to get our food. They didn't comp or discount or offer any vouchers or coupons or anything.   When we opened our food there were no sauces of any kind. I'd waited a long time and was starving and pretty pissed about this oversight after all that. I hopped in the car because, as I said, it's literally around the corner, and junk food just ain't the same without ranch for dippin.   I walked in. Everyone was in the kitchen (no one at the counter), but I was clearly seen, though nobody shouted a greeting or ""I'll be right with you."" Finally a girl walked toward the front, though again not at a speed that anyone in the restaurant business should use. I told her my husband had just waited a ridiculously long time for our take-out order and when he got home there were no sauces, could I just have like six containers of ranch that we should have gotten with our order. Now that may have been an excessive amount, but I had low blood sugar brain. And at this point I figured they'd throw anything at me to appease a dissatisfied customer (because they'd screwed up!). Instead, she looked at the computer and said she needed to get the person who took the order. Why? I have no idea. But she said she was new, so I said fine. She went in to the kitchen to tell another girl who dropped what she was doing to go tell an older man, who I assume is the owner, most certainly the boss. Expecting him to greet me with a smile and an apology, or at least a how can I help you, I was taken aback to get a brusk questioning of who I was and what I ordered. He also needed to look it up on the computer for some godforsaken reason. It was like they all had amnesia! You don't remember the tall skinny dude who JUST left after waiting for his order for an hour?! He told me what I ordered like I was on crack and what was the problem. I said yes, I know what I ordered, but I requested ranch, and even added a generous tip in case he wanted to charge me for it. Again, he rudely asked me how many I wanted, incredulous I was asking. It was like the freakin inquisition. Do they have a problem with ranch robberies??? Are people always walking in and making up stories about how they didn't get ranch with their orders?? He started taking containers out of the fridge. I was so upset by this point that I don't even know what he said that prompted me say ""Wow, you are really something else."" There were four containers of ranch on the counter which I snatched while I could and turned around to walk out, at which point he yelled after me how they're 75 cents a piece. I may have muttered something in return as the door was closing behind me.   I honestly think this was the most disrespectful customer service I have ever received. It certainly tops the list as worst interaction/confrontation with a stranger. I can't believe anyone would treat or talk to anyone like that, let alone a proprietor to a customer. I worked in a restaurant for seven years and one of the cardinal rules is own up and apologize when you make a mistake--99% of the time people will completely understand. Offer them a discount or a freebie and the mistake is completely forgotten.  I realize no one cares or will ever read this. My husband has already chastised me for wasting my energy on it, but I was just so incredulous about the entire thing. It was cathartic. I feel better. Though that will be of little comfort next time I want cheesy bread (with ranch!) and have to order elsewhere."
"Amazing service, great vibe, and fair prices.  Their Asian/Hawaiian fusion was perfect.  We'll be back!"
Real friends show up with BOSA donuts when things are awry. Their boba tea is yummy but needs more ball choices.
"Dined here a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday night -- actually sat at the bar with my three fellow diners and had an absolutely amazing evening -- food, wine, service all made for a perfect experience.  Tried almost all the appetizers and 'small plates' and they were exceptional. Standouts were: almond spread, harcha bread, quinoa salad, beef kefta  Shared a fish tagine for 4 and it was also excellent!  Highly recommend this place - I know we'll be back!"
"I love this place. I come here whenever I'm in town for business. The taco Tuesday deals are unbelievably amazing. The tacos are only two dollars each, but they could be charging much more for the quality that they are. They also have a good IPA on tap that is only five dollars a pint. All of the staff is incredibly nice and they have great music here too. I also love the fact that there's tons of monitors everywhere so you can see games from every angle of the venue. They also have a great outdoor seating area that is right on the sidewalk and located on a busy downtown corner which suits all the people watchers well."
Great food and greatCustomer service.They messed up my order and when they realized they apologized and returned our money.
"Love this place. Great atmosphere - sports bar but with just the right amount of class. Great house beers, friendly serving staff, amazing drunk food. A fun place to go with friends ir family + an adventuruous take on the traditional bar menu"
"Around $45 for a dinner on a Friday night. Snow and Kind crab, caviar, steak tartare, all types of meat and cuts, sushi, soups, Asian cuisine, pastas and pizzas. Literally all you can think about. Almost everything we tried was really good.  Their dessert section and flavors are one of the best !  Recommended for sure"
"We found out about this gem from The Man's co-worker who used to live in the same apt. complex we live in now. It's about a mile away from our apt. and we finally gave it a try a while back.   It is delicious! The chips are mini tortillas that you break off and have with salsa. Very yum. The food is delicious! I don't remember what I had the last time we went here, but I managed to finish more than half of it and had some to take home (tastes better later, IMO). The portions are generous and filling.   The wait staff is always nice and attentive. I remember the first time we visited, it was pretty busy but we didn't have to wait too long for a table.   If we're in the mood for mexican food and don't want a fast food experience, we definitely choose this place."
"Went in on a Friday since I was strolling around the Venetian and came across this place! The wait wasn't too bad around 1pm (probably 25 minutes max). This place serves a variety of Latin American cuisines including tapas, tacos and burgers! It's standard pricing for Vegas. I ordered the brisket tacos and I didn't feel that they tasted anything out of the ordinary. Service was okay, but I thought it was really awesome for the server to ask my party right away if we have any allergies or items that we don't enjoy eating. However, the portions are on the smaller side so it's perfect to have lunch there if you don't want lug any leftovers around!"
"Paid for a view of the strip...Very disappointed.   Viewed the pool, saw through TI facade, Trump tower.  Not worth the extra price.  Restaurant choices were great, food was good, casino was fun.  Rooms are okay.  Would think twice before staying again.  Customer was excellant.  The staff is out standing."
"This place rules! Best tacos in town and not too pricy! Always clean and has an awesome patio.   Staff is friendly, very welcoming.  Will def be back!"
"Without a doubt,  my favorite Indian restaurant to date. There is a lot of variety, but my favorite dish is the chicken korma. The butter chicken is also fantastic. It is deliciously sweet and kid-friendly because it is not too spicy. For those of you who like to feel the burn, they have plenty of options to choose from, as well. I recommend the Thali for people who are just starting to explore their Asian culinary senses. Also, if you are a naan connoisseur, you need add Palais d'Ajit to your list.  Don't expect any fancy surroundings. It looks like a hole in the wall but you'll be convinced to enter the door when you get a whiff of the food (which can be detected from a block away). The staff are very friendly although sometimes the service is slow. If you don't like to wait, call ahead and take it home!"
"OVERALL: The food isn't good (I explain below), but this place may still be worth locals' time (and more importantly money).  Let me explain...  There are not many ""old"" restaurants in this town. We don't seem to value/frequent/patronize places that have been around putting out food for a long time. I think we should. Even when the food isn't show stopping. Why? This place has tremendous character and charm. There's an ""Old Western Vegas"" feel to Bob Taylor's. Established in 1955, it's the oldest restaurant in Las Vegas. Its a throwback to a rugged, carnivorous cowboy culture that has existed in this town for decades. And still exists. I did appreciate the slice of Vegas kitch that Bob Taylor's offers.   FOOD ISSUES: So with all that charm how could this place go wrong? This place could be great. It really should be great. But they are not putting enough care into the food. I ordered the rib eye and asked for it to be medium rare. I was worried about it being overcooked and figured if a mistake was made, I'd be in the medium range. My instincts were correct. But the steak was closer to well done. In total, three steaks at our table were seriously overcooked. In a steakhouse. With a man tasked with grilling the steaks. Sigh. The fourth steak, smoked prime rib, was cooked properly. But the prime rib is cooked ahead if time, right? How was I prepared for this overcooked piece of meat? How did this only occasional red-meat-eater suspect that my steak would not be treated with attentive care?   I'll tell you. When we walked in there was a large grill at the front of the restaurant with a number if steaks cooking on it. But the chef was not watching the meat. He wasn't even in front of the grill. He was nowhere to be seen as we walked through the doors. And there were at least 4 steaks cooking when we arrived. So I figured that my steak would receive the same lack of attention.    I ordered a simple naked potato and a side salad to accompany my steak. Both were fine. But there is not much room to mess up a potato and iceberg, is there? People rave about the garlic bread and I think it's because the rest of the meal is so mediocre, that the cheesy bread becomes the highlight if the meal. It was just OK. The most inexperienced cook could make it at home with sourdough, butter, and three types of cheese.   A few people in our party ordered the mushroom rice side dish and it was not good. After tasting it, I was grateful to have passed on this wet, mush.   SERVICE: Our waitress was very attentive and responsive. She was more than willing to return the overcooked steaks.   I won't be back, but I'm glad to have visited this historic spot.  Service: 4 stars  Kitch: 4 stars  Food: 1 star"
"Azzip Pizza is literally SO good. I have been there so many times and each time I get a ""Big Zip"" for $8.22. The place is amazing and the pizza cooks in about 2 minutes. It is the build your own concept and I have never had a bad experience there. Also, I go there about 4 times a week.. Don't worry I hit the gym, sometimes.."
Love this place.  We go all the time.  Wings are the best cocktails are good and well priced.  Don't confuse with the terrible place with a similar name on Thurnderbird and 43 avenue.
"When I compare Over Easy with other places, maybe I don't find it my ultimate Sunday morning family breakfast place, but I'd definitely drop by with my pals for some home-style fries once in a while...  Everything is what you'd expect from a $10-$15 breakfast, and that's why I gave it 4-stars.  The waitresses are really nice and friendly, which is the kick start of a good morning.  Go with ""The Big Breakfast"" for ~$12 if you're hungry, and I'm telling you, you'd be pretty full by the end of it you wouldn't want lunch!"
"Food is prepared fresh and flavored are great. Eaten three lunches and all were great. Service is a combined effort, so they on top of any needs."
"I ate at New India Bazaar for dinner. I took it to go. I ordered samosa, pani puri chaat, and gobi. The samosas were very good and very big! The main dish, gobi was really great. As a vegetarian it seemed like I was eating chicken, but it was cauliflower dumplings. The gobi had a comfort food appeal. The pani puri chaat was weird. I've never had it before, so I don't have a comparison. The description sounded yummy, but it just wasn't. The total cost was about $14. I would recommend this restaurant. I noticed that they have a pastry case with desserts. I plan to come back to shop. They  have the best prices that I've seen on neem toothpastes."
Awesome food and service! Really wish we had one in Oahu! Our servers were on it! Thank you for working it out and fitting in our party of 9!
"I went here yesterday and I got the best service I ever got at a restaurant. The waiter helped me on the grill constantly checked on me to see if everything was ok, the food was great and so was the service and everything was A++++ pricing was great as well it came out to around $18.  I am going back to Vegas for my Birthday next month I will try there sushis."
"The Four Stars = to  how expensive this place is.  I only saw two dollar signs for this place, but it should be four dollar signs.  I don't remember what I ordered but it all came to $75.00 ( 2 ) bacon egg sandwiches  ( 2 ) other breakfast sandwiches ( 2 ) breakfast desserts ( 2 ) juices or water I'm pretty sure this was all I ordered.  It tasted good because at 2:30am we were all hungry.  I ordered to go since the place was packed from all the clubbers and hotel guests that was here.  I remember that I didn't have to wait very long after placing my order.  I remember that we all scarfed it down in matter of a minute.  I vaguely remember crawling into bed soon after."
"hi, went to anthonys last thurs. night with a party of seven. We were celebrating an anniversary , we all dressed up to the nines ! ! wanted to have a fun nite out !  the food is good, very high end .  2 of us ordered the prime rib, 2 others ordered filet, 3 others steak, plus apps of sashimi, tator tots, mashed potatoes,  spinach, lobster bisques for all, they do charge extra for everything... so watch out, we sat outside it is a nice view..... now the bad part... our waiter, Fabio. I don't like to be disrespectful to our food servers here in Vegas cuz they do work hard, but Fabio is very rude, rushed us during our ordering, did not want to explain the specials after my uncle asked a question, he said he did not know, did not bring our drinks until after our dinner was served by someone else, he was very rude when we asked for another martini and never brought it. he also did not bring water until we asked four times cuz we passed on the bubbles water, he also tried to take out plates before we were done ! the place was empty, three times he wanted to take my plate with food on it ...jeeeez..... Anthonys please he needs more training on how to treat customers :("
"I have visited this place several times. They have great happy hour prices and their regular menu prices are very reasonable too. Their entrees are big enough to share, my favorite is their fish tacos. They tend to get pretty busy on Friday nights, so there is sometimes a bit of a wait. Overall, thumbs up!"
The location was excellent and the restaurant was beautiful. The food was awful and our server was very rude and impolite. We were a group of 6 people and whatever we ordered was worse than another one! Even my little daughter who loves french fries couldn't eat them because they weren't fresh and she thought that they were artificial!!!
"My favorite burger joint! Simple, yet delicious! Service is always great with cheerful greetings and happy smiles."
"Juan's is ALWAYS busy because it's ALWAYS good. It's great food, but the excellent, friendly service is what keeps people coming back. I've been here dozens of times...date nights, with family, with kids, girls nights. Always wonderful. Try the shrimp ceviche!"
Came here while in town for a country concert.  What better way to start our day.  Everything was great.  The service was amazing from the time we walked in the door.  We were sat at a table and to our surprise there is a beer and whiskey tap at the table.  You pay by the ounce and there is a screen to show you what you've drank.  The food we had was great.  The whiskey burger was my favorite.  For you country fans this is a must when in Scottsdale!
"Fabulous. A friend took me here last night. Wonderful food, we had panang curry, duck fried rice and Chilean sea bass.  What a wonderful combination of flavors."
"I was very skeptical about this spot.  First it's almost impossible to find good authentic legit spots on the Las Vegas strip for exotic cuisines- hispanic, Asian middle eastern, etc. If you want one, go off the strip.   second A place that proudly serves ""Middle eastern"" and also ""Greek"" food usually misses those authentic flavors. For example serving Jewish Latkes, Israeli/middle eastern humus, and Greek moussaka is usually just too much for a fusion.   And yet, the food was tasty! Even tough it wasn't 100% loyal to the original flavors or shapes of the Middle East the food was yummy! And I do have to give them a round of applause for their hummus. Simply really good!  The lamb shawarma was also good. And branzino fish with labaneh was on point.   Even though our hostess did a terrible job, our server was lovely.   So bottom line. Worth visiting. A solid 4 stars spot.  Trust me. I know food."
"Worse than before. Overpriced, and HORRIBLE service.  When a group says ""We're really thirsty. Could you please bring water while we look at the menu?"" You'd better frickin' BRING IT!   Our waiter was pushy, rude, and S...L...O...W... When we said that we weren't interested in hearing the specials, he read them anyway.   He constantly tried to upsell us. Every order placed was followed by a pause, and ""Well, you know what would be really good...?"" followed by a big description of a more expensive item or an add-on.  The desperately needed water took almost twenty minutes to get to our table.  The table next to us, who was seated at least five minutes after us, received their water, drinks, and first course before we even got our water.   Do I sound like I'm obsessing about water? In the desert, dehydration is no joke, and it's indicative of the quality (bad - very very bad) of service that we received.  The sushi was good, but not great. The main courses were simple but extremely expensive. All sides were extra. We spent about $250 for three people on very basic food and a glass of wine each.  Never again. Never never never."
"Hands down, this is the best pizza place in Mentor! Their pizza is so delicious that the smell alone is enough to make you drool! The cheesy bread is soft and cheesy and just goodness. The pizza is good for leftovers and the next day. The service and staff is very friendly. 5 stars for sure!"
"I went with the ziti. Just as I remembered, the sauce was awful. The pasta was in a pool of water and the sauce had zero flavor. I just feel like a sauce can make or break the meal, and it was tasteless-- no garlic, onion, wine, basil.. Nothing. The portion was also quite small for the price. It was clearly boxed pasta and not homemade, so why so stingy? I'm surprised there are such high reviews on here actually as my experience and my family's experience wasn't great. I guess it's a decent place for families, but I would definitely go to a different Italian restaurant if you're looking for good food."
"Service was prompt and good. I ordered the roti canai which was excellent and also filling. The chicken curry for the roti wasn't thick, I think that's a good combination as a dip. I also ordered the lamb curry (I forgot the exact name.. Rendang?) the flavor was good but I didn't like the taste of the meat the chicken or beef version is probably better. The lamb meat I feel tastes like lamb sweat. At least that's what I imagined it to be. I only gave it 4 stars because I wasn't satisfied with the lamb meat and some of the items there were a bit pricey. Other than that it's excellent and I like their beverages that they have a grass jelly drink and Malaysian iced tea :). Will definitely come back again next time."
"It's extremely annoying that the Venetian chooses to broadcast Fox News at their VIP lounges against their customers' will and employees' will.  I would consider this harassment since neither have a choice to change the channel. I've tried. I have complained to the employees who state they are not able to change the channel. Trust me, the Venetian customers and their employees do NOT want to be forced to watch Fox News. Please change to a neutral channel or CNN which provides more transparent news."
My boyfriend and I went here for dinner evening and all I can say is it was awesome. Be prepared the drinks are powerful here and we made the mistake of getting Tequila shots on the side..but the frozen Margarita house drinks did not need it. Needless to say we took our time drinking and eating so we could travel home safely. Fantastic time...we will definitely visit this restaurant again... by the way ... I had the chicken shrimp and spinach entree and John had the mahi-mahi tacos... so good!
"I'm a regular at chipotle in California, this is my first visit to this chipotle on s.las Vegas strip.this is pretty new place I think, I took a veggie bowl in which the rice was undone and the fajitas were all burnt, the quantity offered was less than usual. I'm very unhappy with this place."
"What an incredible experience this was. There is nothing particular special about the neighborhood atmosphere, but don't let that deter you. We were seated on the outside patio which was lovely on a warm summer evening. The service was exceptional as the staff was incredibly kind and attentive, but it was the food that really made this experience. From the crispy shrimp appetizer and beef tartar, to the octopus special and veal flank steak, the food was simply amazing. Unfortunately, we're from the San Francisco area so may not be back any time soon, but if this were in our home town neighborhood, we would come back weekly!"
"I have taken my family to this place before.  We were quite happy with the service and food.  Recently, I bought a groupon for this restaurant.  We were not happy at all with the service and food.  First, they ask if we were using groupon and they marked it in a separate sheet.  We had no service at all.  The restaurant was not full and we saw other tables had their food while they order after us.  We waited for almost 30 minutes only two dishes came.   We spoke to the manager and the Waiter for the rest of the orders.  They said to check on our orders.  My kids got hungry and only ate fried rice that came.  Finally when the order dish came and it was very salty.  We would definitely not recommend this place if you plan to buy Groupon.  We felt we were second class.  We would prefer to go elsewhere where we get excellent service and much better vegetarian food and we don't mind paying the little extra,such as graceful vegetarian by market village."
"I had the large cheese pizza. While I sat and waited I observed the following. Phones have the most germs on them of almost anything.  The young man grating the cheese played with his smartphone typing out a few messages. Replaced it to his pocket and continued handling the cheese without washing his hands or using any plastic gloves.  The young lady was cleaning dirty tables with a rag  and spray. Not a problem except when she was done she put the spray bottle up and didn't bother washing her hands either and went immediately to handling food items in the back.  Pizza was fine, but barely had enough cheese on it to cover it. Fair for the price.  On a previous visit I had the gyro sandwich. I found it to be very wet and gooey, not much flavor at all to the meat.  My last visit. I will say the pizza prices are fair for what they are offering.   My problem is the lack of being sanitary."
"Oh man this is going to be a long review so if you want the gist, god awful, do not go. I was so dissapointed with everything that once I got home I had to write a review.  First of All I am Vietnamese and Pho is such a soulful dish, the pho I had today was the worst thing ever.  My parents came to visit with my sister and a friend, and after a long day we wanted to finish with a hot bowl of pho.  I have seen this place, I have even walked by it when I ate at Sura.  There was a smell so tantalizing that I had to go and try it. I thought it would be a good idea to try Jenni Pho Grill tonight.  We walk in saw that the place was not too busy maybe about 7 tables.  We got seated fairly quickly.  Our server was pretty nice, my parents attempted to order in vietnamese but the server informed us that he did not speak it.  Cool cool, no big deal, he seemed like a nice kid.  After that it went downhill from there.  We ordered three bowls of the Pho Dac biet, and two orders of the pho tai.  We finished our order with two thai teas, the jenni jelly drink, and two waters.    My family waited around, no waters, no drinks nothing.  We watched three tables get seated order their food and get their food before we even had anything on our table!  after a 25 min wait, our waiter finally comes back with two waters.  We asked why the service was so slow, he stated that there was only two waiters and said sorry.  So it was fine for now.  After we got the water nothing else came to us.  We watched as the tables that came in after us eat, and one even finished before we were served.  After another 35 minutes, our food finally came out.  First the two dac biet bowls, then the last three.  Finally the drinks came out as well.  I have worked at a boba place before, making thai teas should not take a hour.  For waiting for so long I was really anticipating for a great bowl of pho.  Oh man was I wrong.  The broth was lukewarm, it could not even finish cooking my meat.  The broth tasty funky as if it was made with a pre made powder.  My parents and I watched a one cook was constantly tasting the broth, and we saw no bones that make a great broth.  The bowl was mostly disappointing broth.  There were very little meat and noodles.  We ate, and we wanted to get out as soon as possible.  We asked for a to go cup for the thai tea because it took so long we were just going to take it home.  It took almost another five minutes just to get a plastic cup.    In the end it was just terrible.  My family and I went home unhappy.  And the thing is I love food, I work in the industry so I timing is very important.  Having only two servers is rough but it can not be the only excuse.  If there was something wrong or if it was going to take a little longer, they should inform the customers.  The worst part was watching tables come in before us and eat before we got anything.  I am never going back.  I really hope they clean up their act, there are a lot of pho places out here and if they don't fix things it will be buried beneath the rest."
"Great wings , and the breakfast is pretty good also .the Cook does a great job on the food . I don't drink so I can't say anything about that but over all a good neighborhood place ."
"Their is a bit of a disconnect from the moment you arrive in the parking lot as the signage makes a cool, sophisticated impression that does not match the semi-bland interior. This could be any of the relatively higher chain restos that feels like it needs an update but maybe that's just me?  The food is the thing in any restaurant and pretty much everything was just ok. Our salesman/server;) confidently stated the steak tacos were the best menu item, and they were, but still only rated a just above average 3.5.  I had a ribeye with mashed and seasonal vegetables that was not coked to medium as requested (who knows why they ask in spots like this because it is pretty much never done right?). The accompanying sauce was actually very good and that saved this dish for me.  If Union Social was located closer to where we live it might merit another chance but we live in the south end of Mississauga and thus will be sticking closer to home."
"--LOOK AT MY PICTURE!!!   This is a picture of an **INSECT that I was about to eat!! I was really hungry and decide to stop by and eat.. Thank goodness this was my second plate and I wasn't too full because I gulped down the first plate.. This is your soup of toscana that I was served.   Management provided a friendly compensation, but I don't want anyone to get poisoned, sooo yeah, eat at your own risk!!"
"Im obsessed with this place! Best dishes to try include:   Pozole- which is really filling! Great for when is freezing outside....   Tacos dorados- they are the best ones I have tried in the city!   Enchiladas during the morning on weekends are the best as well, delicious! And if you really want to try real huevos rancheros try them here!!!!! There are some other places in the neighbourhood to claim to offer them and trust me none of the are authentic as they are here. Always a great experience, keep the good work! Prices are so good also considering the freshness and quality of food, one of the best places to eat without breaking your pocket."
"The challah French toast paired with turkey bacon was a pretty awesome breakfast and I thoroughly enjoyed it; however, I felt the staff was lacking in service. They were very nice, just not very prompt and would disappear for quite some time.  I don't know if it was because a few people called out and they were short-staffed or if one should plan to stay awhile.  The food is very good, though."
"The food was great Our server Karu was the bomb he was cool, very nice and good looking guy. It's the perfect spot for the bring friends and group. Great atmosphere and great menu choices.  SPICY... but its good haha.  Defenitely coming back!!!"
Chilaquiles is on point. I bought them last and saved them for breakfast today. The sauce and tortillas were SO good!
"I e-mailed head office months ago about a lousy experience at their Yonge & College Street location and never received a response. Was never a huge fan to begin with but that confirmed things for me.   Oh, and the Cobb salad doesn't have chicken in it anymore...what a rip off!"
"Awful. Nearly inedible... even for airport food.  Don't push the ""prompt service"" button on the table. The waitress said that they ignore it.  Keep walking."
Much better coffee than the big chains.  This is a great place for a quick lunch or breakfast and the drive through makes caffeine fill ups easy.
"This restaurant is a real local secret. Open since 1965, the original owner and chef was still cooking in the kitchen on a Monday night at 10:00 when most restaurants were closed. So happy I found it. Amazing food, wonderful authentic Italian atmosphere and friendly, and well-timed  service in English, French or Italian!"
I love this location. Christina was our server this morning and she was fantastic. As a former waitress I understand how hectic and overwhelming a morning shift can get but she was attentive and very friendly and always kept her cool even with the tons of tables she had.   The food was brought to us within ten minutes of ordering (successfully taming the hangry beast that was brewing) and any modification to our order was done correctly! The food itself was pretty good.  -- I highly recommend the banana nutella crepes.   Overall I was very impressed with this recent visit. Keep up the good work!
I'm not into seafood but it was my husbands birthday and he loves it.. There were other options then seafood that made me happy...and my husband said his was great..
"The service was pretty bad. There were these two grouchy ladies dealing with us at the entrance and we have to wait ridiculously long for a table even though the restaurant is almost empty. Then we have to sit as far away from the food as possible. When we ask to sit closer they say no. We ask why and they say no one is covering that area. Seems like they could easily fix that or make one exception, I mean its a buffet. we won't be needing much service if any.   Luckily that lady who took our drink orders was pretty nice and came over often to clear our plates and refill our mimosas.   The food at the buffet was one of the better buffets I've had in Vegas, definitely better than Monte Carlo's or Harrah's, but nothing compared to Paris or Mirage. I was told Caesar's Palace is the best, but I've never had it. From the looks of it, I'm sure its a million times better than this place. If you want a relatively less expensive buffet where most of the food is tasty and there's a fair amount of variety you might want to go here especially for the mimosa's. We got a great deal from tix4tonight. Definitely check out tix4tonight or a service like it before you go anywhere in Vegas.   One really cool feature here is the salad bar, where they make you a salad fresh for you. I really enjoyed the Chinese Chicken Salad. There's also a dessert area that has more choices than a lot of the other buffets, though the execution of them aren't so great.   Definitely worth going to for the food, but I really thought the service was the worst out of all the restaurants I went to in Vegas. For those reasons I probably won't go back, but I wouldn't tell people not to go."
"My companion and I went to Living Kitchen on an impulse and am very happy to say it was delicious and worth it! My companion got the Arugula Harvest salad and I got the Pad Thai. The Arugula Harvest salad was very tasty and all of the components came together well. The Pad Thai was also very flavorful and had an awesome sauce which had a good afterburn to it. I would highly recommend coming here to try the food vegan, vegetarian, or otherwise."
This place brings back so many memories with my family. It has been here for years and unfortunately the service and food quality has gone down.   During my recent visit I noticed they closed down the second half of the seating area which is disappointing in my book. I go here with my family and we are usually big party so they would  accommodated just fine but now we had to separate the family and sit at different tables or booths just to all fit. Poor choice in closing the extra room after all these years.  The service for the food depends on the day and if Glendale is hosting a event. I don't recommend lunch or dinner here but the breakfast is like any ordinary restaurant. I was on  cleanse one weekend and they were awesome enough to give me egg whites even though it wasn't on the menu.
"We went for brunch. Shrimp, sushi, snow crab legs, crepes made to order, prime rib, etc. etc. Add all you can drink mimosas and we were loving it. 76.00 for two after tip. Would go back for sure."
Freaking BOMB Macaroni & Cheese and Everything Else was Awesome as well great Service again everything was OUTSTANDING
I ordered the Akropolis Pizza and Pork Gyro. The first thing I noticed when the pizza came out was how vibrant the toppings were! You can tell the veggies are fresh just by looking at them. The gyro was one of the best I've had and the fries were awesome. Great service! They really care about giving you a good experience. I will definitely be back!
"So let me start out. The ambiance of the facility is amazing.  Very classy.  But that doesn't compensate for the service I received.   I was the first person at the door and when we walk in we're notified that there is a 30 minute wait for preparation.  I honestly feel they should have came in 30 mins earlier instead of making a customer wait. I was a little disappointed that 2 groups of women with sundresses came in 30 mins after me and received their food before me.  There has to be a Happy medium.   It's not right to let the ""sex sells"" slogan consume your site of all customers being treated fairly and equally.  To be honest I wish had just went to IHOP but I tried to be a good person and support black business.   This place will not be recommended to anybody I know The food on a scale of a 1-10 was a 7 if the service was better I'd give a 8.  My meal was the salmon and grits."
"Being an avid Hookah smoker with a pipe of my own I probably have a little more knowledge about Shisha and the procedures than I need, with that being known this place doesn't clean the pipes after each use and as stated with another review it really doesn't matter a whole lot what flavor you are interested in, double apple is what you will eventually end up tasting.  They use standard bowls to hold the shisha and you get 2 pieces of quick light charcoal.  Being a place that needs to get the customers satisfied, I understand why they use QL's but it will never beat the flavor and duration of a natural wood coal or even compressed coconut shell for burning. I could spend hours discussing their pitfalls and accolades in terms of only their Hookah side of the business but it would most likely just end up sounding drab. So I'll sum it up quick, if you've never smoked a hookah before and want a fairly decent experience, this place will give you a 65-75% good first smoke. If you are someone who is an avid smoker or owns your own pipe, what are you doing out paying for it elsewhere for? You know how it's done, do it up right.   Moving to their food and drink selections. My fiancee and I have tried most of their Juices and found them to be on the whole quite good. Their Oasis Cocktail has some kind of cream that we have yet to identify and I order without most of the time due to the particularly odd flavor it leaves lingering on the tongue.  My fiancee is partial to their strawberry and the banana-honey drinks and orders 2-3 of them at a time if we're there for a long visit.  The hummus was flavored pretty well, and when we ordered a shish-kabob it came out cooked right.  My last visit there I had Shawarma and it was good. Pretty solid foods, drinks, desserts, and hookah. Laid back atmosphere, heaters outside when it gets too cold.  The only thing that could use a smidge improvement is the serving girls are a tad hard to find and you can potentially go 30-45 minutes without seeing one anywhere. Give this place a shot if you're near the area."
"Better than hot & juicy and boiling crab.. They would have gotten 5 starts from me, but they forgot my crab legs! The main reason I wanted to come here.. It was disappointing, but the flavors are really good and the seafood was very fresh.. I love that they use real butter in the sauce and not margarine like all the other crawfish spots!! So this will be my new seafood spot.."
"The nicest hotel I've ever stayed in in Vegas! Found a great deal during the week and couldn't pass it up. Clean, staff is friendly and there's so much food to choose from downstairs! Pretty convenient location on the strip as well. Definitely will stay here again."
"A wonderful dinner experience! Hubby and I came couple months ago, it was our first time at Sushi Samba. We didn't have reservations, but they were able to seat us at the sushi bar.  We had the A5 Wagyu gyoza, was tender and not overdone, Tuna tataki, Chicken Samba was a good size portion, El topo roll, chef sashimi selections, and Tonkotsu ramen. Everything we order was super yummy!  Definitely coming back again next time we're in town!! I would recommend making reservations next time, the sushi bar is kind of tight and if you order a good amount of food, not too much room."
"Danielle was the perfect server - always smiling and came around enough but not too much, made good suggestions and generally let us be silly, nearby table neighbors were great, food was fresh and tasty. I had the crab topped chicken which was juicy and flavorful. The man had ravioli something that was also tasty - fresh pasta and good meat sauce.   The salad and soup and breadsticks are always wonderful. We also got the bruschetta which was really perfect - not specialty, not gourmet, just perfectly normal, fresh tasting tomato, basil and olive oil yumminess.  We also had a trio of their Dolcini desserts which made it perfect so we could have tiramisu and the limoncello and strawberry stuff!  Overall, even though it was really busy and we waited for about 20 minutes for a table (although 'waiting' in the bar having a drink hardly counts as waiting), with the excellent service and great food this place definitely gets 5 stars from me and for a chain restaurant that is definitely something!"
"I'm truly disgusted by the service of this restaurant.  I came in with my family (Mom and Dad) and they said 10 minute wait, we said okay, we notice that they were short with their staff so we waited patiently till we were seated at a table, but that 10 minutes turned into a 30min wait. So the hostess sat us at a table saying how there may be awhile wait, after seeing 2 servers walk by us like we didn't exist, the hostess later seated another table which were 4 Caucasian customers, we were still patiently waited for around another 30min, when those 4 sat down an Asian waiter quickly came to take their order, I got the waiters attention and said excuse me, we came here first. And she made up an excuse saying how ""Oh we wait on different tables probably your waiter is busy"" I knew this was an excuse, I was so disgusted. So we told the hostess that this waiter is waiting on a table after us, and she said oh well we said there would probably be a long wait, and the hostess had the audacity to say ""Oh but they serve the people who come before"" and I said, we were before them, we been waiting 30min at this table and you know this because you sat us at our table"" she said it depends. So in the end we left the restaurant hungry and went to a much better restaurant which served us very well, called Rice Paper."
These are sooo good!  I'm having Bulgogi dog cravings right now!  So tasty!  Want to go back and try the carne asada fries too!  See you soon!
"I have dined here Teppan twice, a la carte twice. The teppan is very well priced and great food but the chef's are tired. Understandable. There is not the same type of showmanship you can get elsewhere but they are good chefs. A la carte sushi is great. Pot of soup is huge and delicious. This is a local place that does well. Service was on point and very attentive last time I came here."
"Came in because our Toronto friends insisted on drinking some ""gator bait"" before we left to go home. This place screams New Orleans to me, and the service is friendly just like the south. We sat at the bar and drank and we were able to see them shuck oysters right in front of us, pretty cool.   Didn't try the food but the menu looked tasty, will try it when we are back in town. But the ""gator bait"" drink was delicious!"
"Absolutely no complaints! Stayed in the Bella Suite with a view. It was a fantastic room; amazing service and friendly staff. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is room service.  Yeah yeah I know and can expect to pay higher prices for room service food, but $34 for hot tea and doughnuts (OUCH!) They charge $5 for room service, but I think that should be free."
The food here is the best Greek food I've had in Arizona. The prices aren't too bad and the service was great. They are really fast too!!
"This Pita Jungle is located in the food court at the Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall. Out of all the eateries in the food court, this is by far and away the healthiest. There are some vegetarian and vegan options for those looking for a meat-free dish. The lentil soup is super yum and they have some great dishes I haven't seen anywhere else. They have several locations in the valley. The one on Ray and Dobson has a patio right next to a small lake. It's a great location, but can get crazy busy, especially during lunch on the weekends or on gorgeous days."
"Went here on new years day to grab a burger. Got in before the OSU game started. Tasty $5 cocktails (in pint glasses, mind you) and good burgers. The fries have large grain salt and were well prepared. I had the Oh Cheesus, which is a burger to be reckoned with. Seems a bit like a rip off from Melt but I didn't care, it's a burger between two grilled cheese sandwiches (with more cheese on top of the burger)    ...I made it healthier by adding spinach on top. Basically health food at that point.  I'll be back!"
"This is a really quaint place for the whole family!  Rows of pinball machines- some vintage, some modern. There are also other various arcade games like Super Mario Bros. and Centipede.  Crane games for all your plushie needs.  Coin machines to turn your bills into coins for the machines.  Vending machines in case you are feeling hungry or thirsty while you play.  Staff walks around to make sure machines are running as they should and refund you if one of them fails while you are playing.  Towards the back, there are more older pinball machines that seem to be out of order or in the process of restoration.. really neat to see!  I believe there is also a prize counter in the back though I'm not sure how that would work.  It is a dimly lit building which allows the lights of the machines to illuminate the area.. Great place to hang out and play some good ol' fashioned arcade games."
I understand Las Vegas is over-priced.  But $50 for a pitcher of mediocre sangria - more than 1/2 way filled with ice - with not a slice of fruit in sight?  ANNOYING.    Friendly staff.  My food (fish tacos) was not nearly as good as the time I had it before.    It is conveniently located very close to the convention center so it gets packed when events are going on.
"Love coming back to this location, one of the best ones I've been to. Have tried other buffalo's and they don't top the service from the metro center store. We always get helped out by Chelsea and she is awesome always has a smile and makes us feel at home, also the team captains are always checking to see if we are good with our orders and drinks"
The food was very good . The waitress was very inventive . The only thing is my I felt so sick after eating it . I'm not sure if it's just my stomach not being able to handle it or what but I felt terrible . The staff at the front was very friendly and talkative
"Looked forward to eating here for so long...too bad it was on my birthday - food was good but the service was deplorable so not going to rehash this too much (apologies to my man and bro as I know they were also hoping for better)  The appetizers were by far the best thing - the entree's were good with red meat being the star.  Peach cobbler desert was all topping that I swear was merely microwaved and had one slice of grilled peach - putting a candle on it did nothing to make me think this was the birthday dessert I was for...   I highly recommend the flight of 10, 20 30 & 40 yr old ports - this mellowed out the complete waste of skin that was our server. Not sure if he thought we looked unable to tip for a spendy bill or weren't as enthralled as the table next to us with his Montana stories but my brother aptly reconfirmed his tip expectation with 7% - too much in my opinion for not giving diddley about someone chosing their restaurant to celebrate in."
"Hy Steakhouse is a contemporary and elegant  traditional steak house, with lots of open space and an intimate dinning experience.  We started with the Famous Cheese Toast, oyster rockerfeller which was 6  sweet and savory but very small oysters.  And the beef tartare, which was made table side and served with small biscuits.  We ended off with the 22 oz. porterhouse steak, which was cooked perfectly to order and was more than enough for the both of us.  Our server was friendly and insightful, and always catered to our needs at the table, other servers were also helpful but tended to their own tables. Although there were several mistakes on our bill initially, such as wrong food and drinks and extra items being billed, our server fixed everything easily.  The room itself was dimmed and the ambiance was more intimate.  In conclusion, the food quality is above standard, service and cleanliness is high, and the atmosphere is intimate. The food is more old fashioned, come here for a great steak done right at a slightly higher price range than the keg."
"This place.  We are staying at the Legacy Golf Resort and that we would grab a quick bite there since we were driving by.  Such a fun atmosphere !  And, fantastic food that has a unique flare and is healthy.  I also like the casual environment where you can play outdoor games with the family. Highly recommend this spot!!!"
"One of my favorite places to eat in town. They have the best bean dip I've ever had. The owner is so kind, and I highly recommend a margarita on the rocks and chicken tacos."
"First time ever coming here even though I live less than a mile away. I have to admit it was fantastic! I ordered the Surf & Turf taco plate. Both of the tacos were full of flavor and tasted very fresh.  I got the Spanish rice instead of beans and it was delicious, not dry and over cooked like most places.  The young man at the register ""Chris"" was very helpful with ordering and extremely pleasant. I will definitely be coming back to check out the $1.50 tacos on Tuesday."
"So I once went to see Brent Spiner, the guy who played Data on Star Trek, talk at a convention (i'm cool) and he opened his little talk by telling us all about how the night before, he'd had a truly unique dining experience.  He went to Burrito Boyz.  His only regret?  Not getting a large.  He's pretty much bang on.  There's very little to regret when it comes to Burrito Boyz.  Their burritos are big and filled to the point of bursting with delicious flavours.  I usually go for the small, because the large really is very large, but I'll indulge once in a while.  They've got a variety of meats you can choose from.  Some favourite being chicken, halibut and beef.  Everything is great really.  Even their level of spice, is always bang on for me.  You can request that they withhold certain things like hot sauce or jalopenos, but trust me, it's not that bad."
"I went here for lunch and got the grilled cajun chicken sandwich and salad, both of which were fine.  The service was really good.  Overall, not a bad place, but nothing spectacular."
"Battista's Hole In the Wall is awesome! Went here for the first time when I was in Vegas for my kickball tourney (WAKApalooza) early October. My teammate is a huge fan and suggested this place to the rest of the team for a big team dinner Saturday night.  It's located right next to the Flamingo Hotel where we were staying, so we were able to walk over. The restaurant is pretty big itself, but the tables are sort of cramped together in small rooms. The decor is awesome. Definitely a friendly, local vibe. Since our party was pretty big (about 14 of us), we had to wait a bit before getting a table. Not a big deal, since we started pre-drinking at the bar. The price range for the meals depends, but all range from $23-40. You get unlimited red or white wine with your meal though, plus all the meals come with Minestrone soup or Italian salad, garlic bread, pasta side & homemade Cappuccino. I ordered the lasagna and it was huge. I probably ate a quarter of it before I got full. I probably wouldn't have been as full if I hadn't filled up on garlic bread, but I couldn't help it - the garlic bread was ah-mazing. The cappuccino was really good too! More of a hot chocolate than coffee to be honest.  Service was good. They were kind enough to split our party in two, to help make the check easier. We even had a gentleman come serenade us with his accordian! I would definitely come back again."
The best aged angus burger fed on carrots..... the staff is awesome too.... can't wait to go back....
"Decent burgers here.  Didn't live up to the hype, though.  One thing that concerned me was the gal cooking the burgers had long hair that was not tied back.  Just an FYI in case you're squeamish about plucking hair out of your food."
"Wow! So fresh, ripe, and sweet! And right in my back yard! I have watched customers go in and out of this small location in the strip mall and always wanted to try this! So glad I did! Can't wait to come back and try everything else!"
I'm so..... Heated... I bought the 3 amigo and it was amazing.... I can't believe they'd serve me something this good
"I should have listened at the other reviews for this place. I got the Hopeful Signature Poke Bowl and it was very bland, and didn't quite sit right in my stomach. Maybe too much sauce? It is comparable to  having salmon sushi ingredients in a bowl with way too much rice. It's too bad, because I love poke bowls and had high hopes for this place. 2 stars for the nice interior."
"One of my favorites for cheap, fast and tasty Mexican! It's definitely low-key and casual, but for a scrumptious chimichanga with terrific queso and a heavy-on-the-tequila margarita, this place has it all!"
"I have a confession to make... I have an obsession with tongue.  That's right folks - tongue. I love it. Name the animal - duck, pig, cow - it's definitely one of the best eating parts of the animal. (what, were thinking about something else? You guys have dirty minds ;P  !) Being Asian, my parents indoctrined this love at a very early age.  When I discovered that Jewish delis were into tongue too (and liver, yum!), I pretty much loved hitting up inexpensive places to nosh.  I was kind of depressed in Vegas because... well, on the Strip, you pass by all these famous delis that basically rape your wallet.  You can imagine how happy I was to find the Bagel Cafe!   My hubby got the pastrami and I ordered the tongue sandwich. Perfection. Really. And not hard on the wallet either which is the best part.  I did try a slice of Boston Creme cake and it is totally junky good."
"Quite possibly the worst meal I have had in ages.  The service was glacial.  I ordered a house salad, but was told not all the ingredients listed on the menu were available.  I ended up with a plate of arugula and a tomato with some not-so-tasty French dressing  We waited for over an hour for the main course to arrive--General Jackson's Chicken.  The menu promises:  ""Boneless, marinated chicken deep fried and tossed in spicy, savory sauce, served with jasmine rice, broccoli and napa""  Spicey sauce?  This sauce was so spicy I was unable to even taste the chicken.  The rice was strictly Uncle Ben's and i saw no broccoli or napa.  We had a couple beers before the meal while waiting.. Total bill:  $55.  I'm not a tightwad, but dinner in a little strip mall restaurant should not set you back $55--or else it should be delectable.  Battiste and Dupree was not the ""hidden gem"" others had told me about.  Hope your mileage differs."
Great food and have good vegetarian options. Always busy  lots of great sauces to choose from
"I was very disappointed with the customer service from the server to the owner which really surprised me, what a BITCH!  I ordered a western omelet with hash browns crispy and when I got the omelet there was no cheese in it. The hash browns were barely cooked. In addition, we wanted coffee refills and no one ever came back to ask us!!  When I inquired about the no cheese the server told me no it doesn't come with it, and when I asked the owner she said that that isn't the correct way western omelets traditionally  are served! She argued with me about the history of the western omelet instead she should have been more focused on her customers being happy, especially since we I told her it was our first time there and we were excited to try her food Quite honestly, I don't look for a class lesson when I go out to eat I just want good food and good customer service, I got neither today!  The correct thing for the server and the half wit owner would have been to say, "" sorry sir but I would be happy to redo your omelet with cheese and make u another order of hash browns and make sure they are crispy"".  But guess what none of that happened!  I have cooked in restaurant my whole life and I have never heard of any omelet not coming with some type of cheese and even if she was correct in her history, she definitely failed me at her customer service skills. In addition, when paying for my food I was told that they only take cash so I had to go out and get cash to pay for this horrible experience and that didn't sit well with me, I almost said screwed it, but my conscience said don't do it, so I went back and paid my bill.  Long story short, if you want good customer service and u want good food I would recommend going to Denny's or Bob Evans. Oh yeah one more thing, if no stars were a choice I would have put none!!!"
"I have been to Vintner Grill twice in two weeks recently.  The first was on Administrative Professionals' Day for lunch.  It was packed and the food was delicious.  As is the usual with Vintner, the service was not great.  Our waiter was friendly (when we saw him), but he just couldn't keep up in his section.  Hubby and I also went back on a Friday at 2:15 for a liquor lunch, and I must say it was one of the best dining experiences we have had in Las Vegas.  The food was excellent as it has always been.  However, for the first time, the service (by Mark), was impeccable.  Was it because there were only a few tables?  Possibly, but something tells me that I have found my go-to server from now on.  He made great recommendations, and the timing of everything was amazing.  Sitting outside and enjoying champagne was heavenly.  Please go to Vintner Grill.  It is worth the drive from the Strip.  Just be patient in case the service is a little slow.  Besides, you never know what celebrity you may see!"
"I've never been to Akina for their AYCE dinners, only for their WONDERFULLY priced bento box set lunches.  Their bento boxes are all set at $5.99.  They come with miso soup, salad, and 3 Cali-rolls.  The boxes themselves are large and usually have like 3-4 different things in them (i.e. Tofu, mixed veg, main course, rice).  Value wise, this has got to be one of the best lunches you can get for $5.99."
Great-tasting deep dish pizzas.  They make a mean calzone as well.  I'm a little sad that they don't use fresh mushrooms.
I am never disappointed with this place. I've yet to eat at the restaurant but the ahi bar is amazing! I always come in to get the spicy ahi bowl and a few sides of ahi. So yummy!
"A must go destination in Phoenix. Chinese - Mexican - Jamaican Fusion Fast Casual (or as I like to call it - Confusion!) It's a Phoenix original.  It's been on Diner's Dives and Drive Ins.  If it's your first time, go up to the counter (to the left of the cash registers) and ask for the orientation - they'll walk you through the ordering process, and give you samples of several of the dishes.  After you do that, grab an order form and pick a 2 item combo and choose 7 9 Black and White.  That's all your really need to know.  :-)  That's Jade Red Chicken, Jerk Chicken, Black Beans and White Rice.  Jade Red Chicken is sort of their take on sweet and sour, but with a spicy twist.  Jerk Chicken is Jamaican influenced (and can be quite spicy some days).  The Black Beans are amazing - stir them into your rice (easier to eat both with your chopsticks when you do this).  And, did I mention, you get a snickerdoodle with your order?  Yep!  Best snickerdoodles around, and one comes with every dish!  If you haven't been to Chino's - it's time - make a run for the border/great wall/beach! (and make sure to read the non-PC T-shirts while you wait - funny!)"
"This is one of my favorite places to eat.  The food is delicious, fresh and almost everything can be made with tofu as a substitute.  The owners are very friendly and the food truly is superb!"
We were here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. We had a party of 6. The server was great. She was on top of filling drinks and making sure to bring out any extras we had asked for with our meals.   I had the turkey chipotle club wrap. It was ok. Nothing special but not bad. The fries are so good! My husband had the open face meatloaf and was really disappointed. He didn't even eat half!
"Went for Saturday Brunch. Wait was doable compare to other buffets. We paid about $38/person which was standard for Vegas buffet. However, everything was underwhelming, nothing really stood out from their selection. For the price and to pay just a little extra, I'd recommend Wicked Spoon or Bachannal"
"Pita jungle is one of our family's favorite places to go for a quick, fresh, healthy meal. The kids love the chipotle chicken flatbread and I am addicted to the Moroccan gazpacho! We feel great when we leave and usually try make better food choices for the rest of the day!"
"I LOVE THEIR CHICKEN STREET TACOS!!!  Btw this Rubio is inside the Monte Carlo ( MGM Resorts employees like Aria,Vdara,Luxor,Mirage etc..) gets 15% off just show your employees I.d."
"I'm not sure what's happened to Futo Buta, but the past couple times we've come it just hasn't been the same.  We've received dirty utensils and the ramen just isn't as good.  Recently took some family over and the food was bland and overly fatty.  I really do hope that it gets back on track because this was one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte!"
"Believe the negative reviews. I came here after a round of golf, in order to have dinner and a few brews. The service wasn't terrible, it was non-existent. The waiter seemed to take an eternity to take our order.   I ordered the Penne with Italian sausage, only to find out, they were out of sausage. The waiter suggested an alternative. I went ahead and ordered it. What I ended up with was penne with canned tomato sauce and what I swear was frozen meatballs. At $12...what a shame.  As I'm done with my food and beer, I wasn't asked if I wanted anything else, my check was just dropped off. Service and food were bad, I will never return."
"Very simple,  yet very tasty wraps.  Corn chowder soup was ok, but the Ravi soup was great with lots of authentic Indian spices."
We love Johnny Rockets. I am not sure what goes on at this location-or if it was just an off day-but the chicken sandwich was inedible. It tasted like nuked chicken.   The shakes were the normal quality-great shakes. Servers were very kind-would have been a one star but not for these two positives.   Our recommendation is to pass on this location. Not a fair example of a typical Johnny Rockets quality.
"Place was okay... Sangria I has was watery & unflavorful, but got me buzzed. That was part of the point of the drink, but I like a craftily concocted cocktail or elixir & this one was not.  But, (I'm using a lot of buts...) the unchicken & waffles was quite okay. They used veggie meat & they did quite a good job making it like chicken. Since I can't do Roscoe's cause I'm a veggie, this spot did the trick. If Roscoe's was in Europe it would be a different story...  It hit the spot. Came with sweet potato mash and collard greens on the side. It was all super healthy. No crazy amounts of butter or oil. Yet, it tasted amazing. But it definitely could have used a side of syrup. What was on there wasn't nearly sufficient enough.  The atmosphere was not to my liking. Very cafe-like and crowded.  But it's an alright spot. I may or may not go back."
"I placed a large takeout order (almost $100) late on a Thursday night and the gentleman made me repeat every part of the order at least twice. He didn't even bother to tell me what time the order would be ready. I frequent this place for lunch and use them for work events pretty frequently and have always had a decent experience but not this time.  When I got home and went to unpack the food, I realized the order was completely wrong. Checked the receipt and the order that was rung in was completely different then what I asked for and with totally different quantities. It was as if the order was erased and the guy just tried to make it up out of memory. Certainly was not please to have ordered mainly calzones and end up with almost all subs.  The most annoying part of the experience is the sausage, pepper and onion subs were 85% peppers and onions. There was about 10 slices of very very thin sausage on the entire sandwhich which I think is a ripoff for $8.99. Terrible experience overall and will highly make me reconsider ever going here again."
Authentic and Rustic full of ambiance.. Great for families aswell as romantic dinners.. Ahhh the memories
"New to Calgary, we did our homework on line and settled for Capo for one of our first meals out. Did not disappoint! A 9 table restaurant, intimate, contemporary but not stuffy decor, washrooms spotless, service friendly and on point. They truly want your dining experience to be a cut above the rest. They are attentive without being intrusive and the FOOD.... the gnocchi was suggested to us by a guest seated nearby who heard we were new to town. This selection was wonderful, pillowy dumpling puffs with lobster and truffle oil... I was sold! My husband and I shared this plate of deliciousness and the restaurant will split the plate for you in the kitchen, no problem. The fresh bread came with shallot butter - WOW, a must try, I love flavoured butters! For the main meal trio, I got the Dock Side which is a perfect scallop, perfect shrimp and the most tender, buttery fish filet once can ask for. My husband chose the meat option and he too could only describe his filet as ""butter"" and loved everything else that accompanied it. The small hot pots with the fresh veg inside in a butter broth were hits as well! The sparkling volcanic water was a nice change for us and the wine list was beyond impressive. We each had one glass, a red and white. MMMMM! Everything here is 100% Italian including the waiters and it was so nice to see how knowledgeable they are about the menu and passionate about what they serve! The chef obviously took a lot of pride in her work and created for us, THE perfect plates! The end of the meal sadly came and although we were stuffed, we chose to share the lemon curd with berries plate to cleanse the palate. The best choice we could of made - or was it?! We will have to find out next time we come! We enjoyed the location of Capo in Inglewood, quite central and the waiter who called a taxi for us even waited with us outside chatting with us until the cab came. What a gem of an eatery if you can afford to splurge now and then! A highlight of my week and would recommend to anyone!"
Never had Belizean food or have heard of them and they're right in front of my building for 7 months. Finally made my way over there and it's so dang good! Chicken fell off the bone. I ordered tamales since it's the special right now and it's huge for $5.50! Why did I wait so long! I was skeptical at first didn't know what to expect. Owners are super nice.
"Fajitas on Fire.  5 beers in a bucket for $15. Good chips and Salsa.  Mariachi Band.  Strategic TV's for all seats.  Excellent Margaritas. Kid friendly. This place rocks!!!  Out of all the places in Las Vegas to pick for Cinco de Mayo food, drinks, and music, we picked this one based on YELP reviews.  We were first time visitors.  We will definitely return very soon!    We arrived early to avoid long waits and drunk people.  By the time we left, we might have been the very people we were trying to avoid!  Drinks aside, we enjoyed the flaming fajitas!  We ordered the fajitas for 2 with steak and shrimp.  It is more than enough for 2 people.  My hubs and I made 7 fajitas from the meat.  We can't speak to any of the other food.  OH WAIT!  Now I remember, we had an AMAZING desert.  A sopapilla topped with ice cream and strawberries.  It was DELISH!!    We met Juan the owner who welcomed us and our little toddler.  Juan said he built the place to accomodate families and that their daily Happy Hours are restaurant-wide - and not exclusive to the bar only like many places in town.  Their daily happy hour from 3-7pm looked really good!   Our server was very friendly and the service was great!  The Mariachi band was an added bonus - we would love to return to hear them again.  They were very good!    This is a place worth visiting!  Good food, good drinks, good prices, and good service!  Locally owned.  Flaming Fajitas - what more can you ask for!!!"
Over priced nasty nachos. The meat was so salty I couldn't eat them. And they tried to sell me a regular bottled water for $7. I will never go to this place again!!! This place sucks!!
"After a day of shopping at the local mall and with dinner still hours off, a friend and I popped into Grazie (based on a recommendation from a former Phoenix resident) for a snack.  Didn't hurt that my hotel was just up the street.  After a quick review of the menu, pizza seemed the best option and settled on the Capricciosa (Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Artichokes, Olives, Mushrooms, Salame, Ham, Parmigiano Reggian).  The pie emerged from the wood fire oven piping hot, with a slightly burnt crust.  It lasted approximately 5 minutes before vanishing into our hungry bellies.    Wine list is all-Italian and well priced, with many by the glass selections.  I opted for a nice Barbera, which was poured generously into a large glass.  I'd be a regular if living in the area."
"Was amazing the first visit (when corporate was still overseeing their operations during the first few weeks of opening). The second visit was horrible.  We won't be returning. The salads were watery and tasteless, the fries were old burnt and overseasoned, the restaurant was dirty and the tables sticky, and the staff was impatient and unprofessional."
"Unfortunately, I don't understand the negative reviews, maybe it was bad timing? But I LOVED the crazy burger. I brought my American friend and he had the Green burger, and was impressed about how good it was. SUPER friendly staff, they made sure I had every condiment (ketchup, napkins etc.) I didn't expect any service at all from a burger joint but it was an pleasant addition. I'll be coming back for the food and the exceptional service. I've never had such a nice experience at a burger joint before. I'd recommend the Crazy Burger combo (Onion rings and Boylan's Black Cherry Soda). Although it was a bit messy it was delicious, and I loved every single bite of it. I'll definitely be coming back soon."
Listen people this is the spot. Stop paying too much at over priced place where the portions are small and mash potatoes are green. This place portion size it meant to feed a horse not a mouse like the other places. Like I'm coming back here over and over again. Plus my gf lives not far is its convenient.
"Had a fantastic experience dining at Olive & Ivy! Believe it or not, we even thoroughly enjoyed dining outside in the August Scottsdale swelter- their misting system works amazingly well.  Went with my daughter and two of her friends- and I totally loved this place! I liked the high ceilings, the cozy decor, the lighting, and the marketplace feel of the interior... Because of numerous raves on yelp, we ordered the bacon wrapped dates for an appetizer. It's true, they are totally fabulous- not to be missed!   I had chicken scaloppini, which was delicious- perfectly prepared, and served with just the right amount of sauce and Mediterranean olives. The girls all ordered pasta dishes- raved about, and then subsequently demolished them. There wasn't one crumb of food left on anyone's plate!   The focaccia bread with pesto is wonderful, and they have a great wine list here. I had a glass of Syrah from Washington state, which was thankfully served at the right temperature and was very nicely balanced. We were celebrating one of my daughter's friend's birthdays, so our delightful waiter brought us a complimentary dessert- an ""ice cream bar,"" which had ice cream, marshmallow, and lots of rich, luscious chocolate. It was totally delicious, and reminded us of a s'more.  Olive & Ivy is a nice place to people watch- the patio fronts the waterfront, and reminded me of a sidewalk cafe in Europe. I will definitely be back- only wish we had an Olive & Ivy in Tucson!"
"This is a tricky one. AB is a really cool looking spot, really nice decor and ambiance, comfy booths, it even smells like a new car.  My group was greeted promptly by smiling hosts, and seated in a nice booth. Drink orders were placed, and when our margaritas arrived, they were really, really off and tasted terrible. Even after stirring, and thinking positive thoughts- they just were off- not sweet enough, and didn't taste good. Our server was cool and he swapped them out for other stuff. My replacement drink was a Polish Fizz, and it was perfect. Highly recommended.  For an app we went with the pretzel fondue, thanks to Yelpers who recommended it. As advertised, it was delicious, and I recommend it. For lunch I had the fish and chips, and my friend had some salad. The fish and chips were very tasty, but the price point, for the portion I got- just didn't compute. Three pieces of fish (think chicken tender size) and a small portion of fries, along with a small side of overly vinegared cole slaw. Again, the food was good, but you definitely don't get what you pay for. I understand the concept of smaller portions, euro style, etc. but for a bar food staple? I wasn't looking for a Costco serving of anything, but either bump up portion size, or drop the price from $16 to $11.50.  I really liked our server, but for some reason as things went on, he was more and more absent. To be fair, we had a really difficult person that joined us, some of the stuff this person said made me want to pull my hair out, so I feel his pain.  Anyway, AB is a very attractive spot that might be great for drinks and app. but for this price point, I would hit Durant's, Hillstone, or Beckett's Table. It's nice to leave a spot feeling that you got your monies worth, and that just doesn't happen here."
"Ping Pang Pong has always been an outstanding choice in terms of Chinese food here in the valley. What is so surprising is that most Chinese restaurants inside the hotels & casinos really are sub-par. The very basic essence of clean, fresh and friendly is the definition here, and the food is quite authentic. The servers work quite hard and there is a decent presence of managenent staff to ensure smooth operations. The XO sauce is very tasty, but be careful if you order it on the side as they will charge you for it (not exactly cheap). Still, I have been quite pleased with the food & service upon every visit for a number of years now. Definitely recommend -"
"Wish I could give this place 0 stars. We have had issues here before with being seated (it took them 15 minutes when the place was empty one time), but tonight takes the cake.       We went to get food at 2am, pulled into the drive thru at 2:32. We waited there for 15 minutes, then we got trapped in the drive thru by a curb and other vehicles for 25 more minutes. I got incredibly fed up and walked inside. There were 2 tables seated - and they were already eating. One woman was ordering at the counter when I went in.       I asked the worker at the counter if they shut down the drive thru and if they could inform the people waiting at the speaker because we were stuck and just wanted to leave. All he said is ""I don't know if they shut down the drive thru but I can take your order here."" Like THAT DOESNT HELP US. We are STILL stuck in your crappy little drive thru and we don't even want to order here anymore. He said he would meet me outside - which he DIDNT by the way, but the line started to move so we said whatever and decided to still order because we had already waited 40 minutes.      After they got the person in front of us through the drive thru, they then told US to hold on a minutes because they are ""backed up inside"", but they weren't at all. The parking lot had 2 cars and 3 people behind us in line, and when I was inside, a server was sitting at a table texting. So don't tell me you are busy if your staff is getting paid for nothing. I yelled ""are you getting paid for this?"" Through the speaker and he had time to answer and tell me to CALM DOWN but couldn't take my damn order.      We finally left with out even PLACING an order after 49 minutes. Will not return and by the other reviews for this place, I should have checked yelp before ever coming here in the first place. Went to the Mentor one after and got served right away."
"Not the best pizza, but not the worst, and it's only $7. I've only had the pepperoni, but they have plenty of variety. The guy behind the counter was super friendly. Remember- cash only!"
"I have actually visited the Village Seafood Buffet at The Rio three times. Each time I have enjoyed myself.  I was torn on whether to give this 3 or 4 stars. The reasons I chose 3 is because when I want a plethora of seafood, I know I can come here and have good eats but it is on the expensive side.  The options are always solid and depending on the visit, the choices can vary just a bit. Expect to wait in line for a bit and come with a very empty belly. You will want to get the most for your money."
Great food and prices.  Servings are generous and the atmosphere is good.  A nice place for traditional Mexican in Old Town.  Really liked the Pollo Relleno.
"Below average food. The service can be spotty, depending on the time of day.  Just..look elsehwere. I'm surprised they are still in business."
"Paco's Tacos is the real deal! In spite of the great Yelp reviews, I still had my reservations about eating at another TexMex chain. How good could it be I thought? Well they totally nailed it, from the complementary chips and dip to the sauce stains on my napkin!  The dining area was empty and only a few people were at the bar upon my arrival for a late lunch. Adlai our server was very helpful with recommendations and was knowledgeable of the menu. I had a overstuffed grilled chicken taco which arrived with Mexican rice, mixed cabbage coleslaw and, their own, Charro style pintos, all at the incredible price of... drum roll please... 7 Bucks! My buddy tried Paco's Taco which is shredded beef and was equally as tasty. Servings are huge and everything was fantastic.   Premeal chips and salsa were delivered to the table immediately. The chips are very thin and were very fresh. The place was clean and attractive. Sanitation rating was a 95. For those long time Charlotteans like myself, you may remember this place as the old Manzetti's.  I'm going back soon! This place is a Gotta Try!."
"The food is great we did a rib eye & a sirloin pretty basic cuts, both were done correctly. The mushroom ravioli appetizer is special, the tuna as well...The decor is nice and makes this place a nice one for 'special' dinners. As others have mentioned it is pricey with a good tip for good service we were at $185 for two appetizers, two sides, two steaks and one glass of wine... hummm...."
"We used to come pretty frequently when it was Joey's. When they changed over to North and South, we were a bit apprehensive about the addition of bbq and stayed away. It took a Yelp event to introduce us to the owners and the ways and whys of North and South. It was great  talking with them about what's new and learning about the cooking processes. We decided to try it out again after tasting their amazing St Louis ribs. We loved eating the ribs so much, I wanted to get a smoker. But why bother, when you can save time by ordering by the pound! I've never been much of a ribs person, but the entire family goes ga-ga over the ribs. It's like a ""don't you dare touch my leftovers"" kinda feeling after eating here. The waitress/hostess we had was pretty awesome too. Her positive attitude and the info she provided about menu items made it a comfortable environment for us. We'll be back!"
"i did not stay at this hotel but i did visit the hotel and the shops. Beautiful place!!!! not too crowded, very quiet and peaceful... I love this place. This hotel is located on the strip on the north end.. It's less crowded on the north and there is a mall right across the street. This hotel has many high end stores for shopping such as LV, Cartier, etc, but there is a regular mall across the street with Macy's, forever 21, etc..  The gondola rides are nice, but short!! it's 19.95 a person and it's 10mins long. They can stay in doors and out doors with the gondola. I heard out door is better at night because of the lights. Great overall experience, wonderful restaurants, awesome shops.."
"Maybe because it was rainy outside, or the bartendress was on the rag, but the service I experienced was ATROCIOUS. This is after only my second experience here. My first experience was in the summer where I hung around the bar (on the most uncomfortable chairs I've ever sat on) and things were pretty cheery.  This time I ordered from the happy hour menu & apparently when you do this, you must sit at the bar---lame. The bartendress was in a super bitchy mood and poked fun at the fact that I was ordering from the happy hour menu. HELLO? We're not all snobby rich middle-aged Myers Park folk. I prefer beer & I wanted some Olde Mecklenburg Brewery Mecktoberfest, but the bartendress convinces me it isn't good because it's the last of the keg. Great. Personally, I don't do cheap beer, and nothing else looked good, so I stuck with water. At this, she snickers, ""so just water and some apps.....MMMKAYY"" while giving stink eyes. Excuse me? Who pissed in your cornflakes, lady?   Eventually the order comes in: Risotto fritters, Gouda grilled cheese and tomato fondue, koby beef sliders, weird salmon dip. All that was pretty good, no complaints there. This was the whole reason I came in the first place.  NEEDLESS TO SAY I LEFT A GOOD TIP BECAUSE I'M THAT KIND OF A GUY. But honestly, this woman did not deserve one stinking penny, and I'll probably never go back here because of her attitude. It's sad to say because I live in this neighborhood and I like supporting this neighborhood's businesses.   I work with all sorts of people on a daily basis, and work for tips myself, and it benefits no one when you bring your foul mood to the table, in fact it only detracts from possible future business."
"Out shopping (gross), I got a hankering for Mexican food, and Border MX was the best rated option that came up.  Overall, food was pretty good (chimichanga al pastor, flag enchilladas, and guacamole and chips) - though it was really slow coming out (despite not being busy), and the enchiladas were not as hot as my missus expected they would be. That said, drinks (including really good micheladas) were good, the guac was excellent, and overall, we left pretty happy (they Yelp special churros were a nice touch) - not an area I'm in a lot, but definitely impressed me with the authenticity - it was just the lag and the temperature of the food that was a little off."
"If you like thin greasy pizza, then Alexander's Pizza is good for you. The $6 large pizza is a nice deal, and I do admit the flavor is marginally better than Caesar's $5 pizza. The only problem was how sparse the cheese was and the cardboard box the pizza sat in was literally soaking WET from being drenched in oil.   Alexander's pizza also serves Italian and Greek entree meals. The pizza was disappointing, but their homemade (?) ranch dressing is out of this world! It's creamy, thick, and very nicely seasoned to go with their surprisingly fresh salads. Their ranch dressing really is superb and the family that runs this place seem very nice. Not the friendliest bunch of people, but you can tell their honest and work hard."
"Lovely food. I am also happy to eat at this location of paradise bakery.. they have fresh ingredients and make good alterations if asked for. Great for vegetarians and well as non vegetarians. Fact that this location is in tempe marketplace, makes a high difference so we can enjoy outdoor seating in evenings."
"Having dined at many other Vegas buffets (the Wynn, the Paris, the Mirage, etc.) I found myself very underwhelmed. Everyone raves about the Bellagio buffet but I just kept wishing I had gone to the Wynn. The decor is decent and the quality of the food is good, but there wasn't much of an assortment. I went for 4th of July brunch at around 11:30am and the sushi bar wasn't open, there was not a single pasta dish, the slice of meat I got was fatty and veiny, and our drinks took 20+ minutes to arrive. I will say that the fruit was fresh and yummy (melon, berries, etc.) and the desserts were good, but it wasn't enough to make me want to come back here ever again."
The food is great and the prices are reasonable. They give you a nice amount of food for what you pay for.
"This is my new favorite restaurant in Surprise, which isn't very hard to do because surprise is full of nasty chain restaurants. However, if you want to eat some darn good vietnamese food, this is the place. The pho of any type is amazing, even to go. Also try the spring rolls. Make sure you wrap them in the lettuce with a bit of mint, the texture is bomb fool! It gets a little crowded around 6pm because all of Sun City eats dinner around that time. So show up around 7pm and you'll be fine."
"It wasn't as great as expected. I'm a crispy bacon guy! The bacon here was borderline crispy and too salty (surprisingly) The smoked salmon was extra salty. The churros tasted funny and the chicken taquitos were flavorless. The juice selection was limited: Apple, orange and cranberry. Bring on grapefruit and pineapple! It wasn't all bad. The breakfast potatoes, corned beef hash, turkey sausage and cheese grits were good."
"Great steak. Great service. Cool venue. Although it's died down a bit, this place is still always on my radar for good food."
"Oh my gosh.. BOMBBBBBBBB!!! This place is so amazing!! The food is incredible! I have had almost everything on the menu. They have milk shake happy hour every day between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. with half price milkshakes. The first time you go in, tell them its your first time and they will give you a sample of all of their different sauces. My two favorite are sweet heat and creamy garlic. The staff is incredibly friendly and personable. The restaurant is clean and the hand washing station is pretty neat. Go check it out you will not be disappointed!"
"I have eaten at Pan Asian about 15+ times, and have taken several friends here.   I give it 5 stars because the food is insanely good. How anyone can give the food less than 5 stars is beyond me. I am a food critic and have eaten at hundreds of restaurants. Pan Asian is up there of one of my all time favorites. How anyone can give this place less than 4 stars is beyond me. There are always going to be those negative nellys that only look for what they can complain about.   I give the space and decor 4/5 stars - it is small and decor is minimal, but it works.   Miso Soup, Massaman Curry, Basil Fried Rice, and a Thai Iced Tea  is my fav at the moment and what I wish I was eating right now..."
"Had the soup and sandwich.  Wow, it was great.  I can't wait to return."
"To be honest, I was a bit disappointed. Had the original philly, but it was so bland, I even needed to add a bit of salt to bring out the flavor of the red sauce. Note: the sauce is not at all spicy. Ill say, they ensure to keep the food warm even for pick up, so thats nice, the cheese was still hot when I had it at home. Also the people are really polite and nice. But not a place ill be trying anytime soon."
"Dismal, lukewarm, defrosted-tasting ""TexMex"" glop;  Mumbly, unengaged waiter;  Clueless manager, who seeing us with barely nibbled entrees on plates shoved forward for pickup, thanked us perfunctorily for our patronage;  We're from the Texas Hill Country; down there, we jail critters  who serve up grub this bad, for their own protection.  Never, never, NEVER again (Back to Yard House for real food)"
"The only thing I found interesting about the place was the self tap tables which I didn't sit at. The service was horrible, my Bloody Mary was disgusting, and the place was a sausage fest ( too many guys). Also I was extremely disappointed by the small dance floor. I knew Dierks Bently was a sellout when they opened their bar in old town Scottsdale. This place is not true to country roots at all."
"We ate here for a friend's birthday before seeing Ka (theater is right next to this restaurant in the MGM Grand). It's a great before/after show restaurant. We had a reservation and were seated right away after checking in with the hostess. The restaurant is open, so you can see the bar, kitchen, and casino floor.  I ordered the special that night, which was pappardelle pasta, a chunky tomato sauce, shredded lamb, kale, truffle-infused breadcrumbs, and freshly shredded parmesan. I was torn between several items on the menu, but I wanted a special since I was in Vegas for the weekend. It was phenomenal! I rarely eat lamb, and this was delicious. It was incredibly tender and tasted delicious. The sauce was very thick, almost like tomato chunks, but I didn't even feel like I was eating a tomato sauce. The balance of sauce, meat and kale was absolutely perfect.  I also had their moscow mule. Cocktails were expensive, so I decided to go for one that was all alcohol. Others in our group had several cocktails that were all extremely tasty. Additionally, I tried a few bites of what my friends had. I had a bite of the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatball melts in your mouth, and the sauce was phenomenal. The linguini and clams came in the most decadent white wine sauce with perfectly prepared clams. The french onion soup was rich, buttery, and tasted phenomenal.   They brought us a chocolate cheesecake as the complimentary birthday dessert and wrote ""Happy Birthday"" in raspberry sauce. The cheesecake had chocolate drizzled on top and edible pearls garnishing the plate. The waiter said it was always a surprise as to what the chef prepared for the complimentary birthday dessert.  Yes, this restaurant is pricey (although not by Vegas standards). However, you will have an excellent meal and receive spectacular service. The waiter took excellent care of us. He was really funny and made sure everything came out perfectly. The bussers constantly refilled water and ensure we had everything we needed. This is an incredibly unique, delicious restaurant."
"Had a groupon decided to check it out, steak was good, server was lacking. It was busy and loud which wasn't bad but it was our first time there, so we weren't familiar withthe menu. Some of us had steak and some had salmon. The salmon came with sides and the steak did not. I wish the server would have told us more about the menu or asked if we wan't sides. The server checked in once and never offered anyone a refill of their drinks.  It felt like they were put out by the groupon and didn't want to deal with us. Prob won't return."
"Best fried pickles in town! Great prices, fabulous and friendly staff. Zero complaints."
"First I want to say that our group had an AMAZING time at Encore Beach!!!!!  BUT, we did end up dropping a ton of cash.  If you read the reviews carefully, you'll notice that the people who had the best time are usually the ones who bought a lily pad, or a couch area.  It was a $500 minimum for the couch area by the blackjack tables, but I'm telling you that it was 100% worth it!  We had a bottle of Vodka and ordered some food and it was yummy :)  There was one UGLY thing about this place though which is why I removed 1 star, and that is that they don't allow ""oversized"" bags or backpacks and force you to check them for $20!!  $20!!!!  It's insane!  It really pissed off our group at first cause there were 2 of us with big bags, but at least they let us put them together for $20 total.  Jerks.....  I'm sure there's some good reason for not having oversized bags, but they didn't tell us.  One other messed up thing that happened is that we were approached by a promoter the night before after leaving XS and he offered us free admission AND a cabana for free.  We were like, hell yes!!  And then we we get to Encore Beach, the guy isn't around and no one would help us and we were stuck paying for the spot ourselves.  We were pretty pissed about that too, but we didn't let it ruin our time and got over it and just ended up paying.  OK, back to the good about this place:  The people are VERY friendly.  Everyone's there to have a good time!  We talked to lots of people and the couple next to us on the couch were awesome!  Overall we just had sooooo much fun!  Great music, dancing in the pool and at our area.  It would not have been as much fun if we didn't pay for that space though.  So suck it up and pay or else stay at your hotel pool (which was also awesome at Aria)."
"Amazing Burgers. The combinations of ingredients is Fantabulous   It's difficult to have a favorite and yes, I've had every item on the menu"
"OK, this buffet is pricey.  Something in the neighborhood of $48 i think, but if you go to the Tix4Tonight or similar vendors you can buy a voucher for $2 that gets you into the buffet for $33 and change, so a total of $35... a $10 savings. A bottle of OK wine is 12 bucks and this becomes a really fun evening. Some complain that the food isn't prepared like some 5 star restaurant, but guess what... This isn't a 5 star restaurant... it's a decent buffet where you can try a little or a lot of everything. It's just fun, and a lot cheaper than those fancy chef name places in the hotels. Oysters,  crab, all kinds of fish and shellfish and lobsters. They have all of this and lots of veges and other dishes. I really like the dessert selection but admittedly,  when I am full of wine, crab, scallops and oysters the deserts start looking less attractive. Food critics, say what you like... the restaurant that fills up nightly for years and years is doing something that real people like! Don't forget to hit the half price ticket place for your discount vouchers before you go!"
"This place serves consistently good Americanized Middle Eastern food. I've had  tuna and lamb plates here, and they've been good. The flavors won't blow you away but just about everything on the menu is tasty and well prepared. Wait staff has been knowledgeable about the food each time I've been there.  Waterworks location doesn't have a liquor license but there's a state wine store nearby and you can bring a bottle into the restaurant."
"Bruh, I'm a stickler for good wings.  Like to the point I can only eat them from about 4 places and I find those places to usually be inferior to the ones I make with my brother.  This place is a grade A dive and dump.  It is small, old, and needs remodeled,  but the wings are still great!  They get crispy right.  And, the service was nice too.  The Buffalo  (seems like a standard combo of whirl and franks) someone is mixed in a way that exceeds other standard buffalo combos.   Also enjoyed the dry cajun.  The sirachi were a bit of a miss though.  Also, get the fries.  Get a small because they give you so many, but man they are good.  In short, take it from a wing expert...  the bad reviews are bunk or are based on that customer having bad service."
"Despite the decor, the food was amazing.  My dad and I had the fajtas the first night we were in Scottsdale and boy were we surprised.   Our waitress was amazing as she told us a unique way to get to the Grand Canyon, which we didn't regret.  Salsa was amazing and my mom probably ate most of it.  If I ever go back, I hopefully will go back there for some Mexican.  Was there on 2/15/2012."
"Everything on the menu has a picture so you know what you're getting, the coffee was on point and adorable foam design."
"Good tex.mex food. Live close so easy for me. Good margaritas. Decent service. Prefer the local mexican places, but this place is good and closeby. Upset that I don't get my work discount anymore.:-(  But will return."
The chips and salsa are so fresh and tasty that I could fill up on just those. They're addictive! We love the Paco's Taco with braised beef and charro beans. They have so many different tequilas & their drink menu is extensive and impressive. Margaritas are unbelievable. Highly recommended.
"Been going here since summer, i am so glad i have discovered this jem! This joint beats any other sushi spot, even though its an izakaya. The menu is extensive. My faves are obviously tsuki don(a must try!) which no other place has, grilled squid that is cooked to perfection which is also rare nowadays, sashimi salad is to die for, and tamaguro roll with red tuna, tomatoes and garlic sauce. I mean everything else that Iv tried here is also delicious. Their lunch boxes are of a great value.The place has great ambience and music, service is always very consistent. This place is good for a quick lunch, big party or nice dinner. Its simply a spot to-go-to! Can't wait to go back!"
"Love love love Kelly's!   I just discovered this spot while I was doing The Taste of Scottsdale tour.  We stopped there for dessert.  The restaurant gives you the feel of an elegant Irish pub.  They have a pool table, dart board, putting green and HUGE patio!  In the past, I always thought of Kelly's as a bar or late night hang out (which is not really my thing) but I was very wrong!  Their menu looked amazing!  They have an ""award winning"" four cut burger--which I will try next time!  Dessert was delish!  We had the doughnut holes and Kelly's twinkie.  Both were excellent!   I was most impressed with the service!  We were greeted right away.  While we were eating our dessert both a manager and the chef stopped by to check on us.  I was most impressed that the chef and manager cared so much about our experience!  A+ service!  I'm glad I found this new gem in Old Town Scottsdale!    I can't wait to go back to Kelly's!"
"Where do I start!? Came here for the first time today and was a little shocked at the prices; we were already sitting down with our two little ones and they were hungry so we weren't going to try and look for another place to eat. We ordered the fried pickles to start with, and wow! I could not believe the size of these things! Shortly after we got our meals, and once again the portions were huge! I finally understood why things were priced the way they were. Everything was sooo good; we will definitely eat here again!"
"I've been debating about writing this review.  I love cupcakes and I was so excited when I so this store.  The store inside the mall is very cute.  The staff is amicable, but not overly helpful.  Which is ok, the cupcakes look good, however, looks are not all, even for cupcakes.  I got the Lemon Raspberry and the Coconut, as well as a Key Lime cake pop.  I tried the cake pop first.  It was gummy tasting and neon green.  I have been to Key West and I never saw a neon green key lime.  Then I took a bite out of the coconut one.  The cake per se was not bad, however the frosting tasted like oil.  Not appetizing.  So, I closed the little container and tried the Lemon Raspberry.  I guess I have been spoiled by other cupcakes in town.  Again, the neon yellow color for the cake.  Where do they get these citrus. (see picture)  The cake tasted like the ones from the grocery store.  I ended up throwing them in my garbage, making sure to smoosh it down, in case I had a Miranda moment (only if you have watched Sex and the City you will get this).  At least I know I won't be tempted at the mall anymore.  I guess I should be thankful????"
"A local favorite, this hole in the wall serves home cooked food that does not disappoint.  I orders two eggs over easy with bacon and rye toast.  The food was cooked to order- hot, tasty and the bacon was thick, crisp and flavorful, just like I hoped it would be.   The waitstaff is very friendly and took great care of us.  They chatted with everyone who came in and made them feel at home.  One reminder if you go..... bring cash.  No crest or debit cards taken here!"
"Our nine person group stopped in while experiencing the ""Glendale Glitters"" celebration for dinner.  We tried to call ahead and make reservations but they informed me that they did not take reservations.   I have eaten here from the 1980's forward to today, so I was familiar with the menu and layout.  It wasn't very busy and the hostess got us right in and let us pick out where we all wanted wanted to sit. The menu felt abbreviated in relation to what I remembered from years past.  Maybe this was a limited holiday menu? Anyway the food was ""good"" but nothing ""popped"".  I got the feeling the chips came out of a big bag, not warm/hot...the salsa was ""ok"" but a little thin, nothing on the menu that you couldn't find at any generic Mexican style restaurant.... Overall the meal was good and the price was reasonable but I was hoping to show the place off and I was sort of let down.  They did have live music and the guitar player/singer wasn't bad.  Would I return?  Yes, for a quick lunch.  But I really think this place is performing below it's potential."
"3.5. Patio is great and spacious. Selection of beer and menu also great. I came here because of the more sophisticated menu variety. I ordered the steak tartare. It's okay, but if you've had steak tartare done right before skip it here. They use a chicken egg yolk. Tartare itself is not seasoned enough and left more to be desired. Salmon quinoa bloated. Duck fries were quite good and a large portion too. In terms of fruity beers, I didn't like my friend's cherry beer (reminded me of medicine taste(, but my peach beer was quite interesting and more bitter than I thought. The seating with half booth half stools are a bit weird, apparently my back doesn't like backless chairs. Either way, I would come back if I want beer in a less rowdy bar with an interesting menu for food."
"I made a yelp account just so I could write this review, that's how rude the staff is here! The first time I came here I thought maybe it was just a one time thing. But they are consistently, unfailingly, disrespectful. I will never in my life come back here again."
"Pastries are pretty good, but their iced coffee is terrible. Tastes more liked iced tea than iced coffee if I had to make a comparison, but I've had much better iced tea even. Hate to say it, I love local coffee shops, but I can't recommend their coffee. Hope their food is better!"
"Guarantee you will leave with a full and happy tummy. Not only is the good great, the customer service here is amazing. Can't beat their complementary bean dip and salsa! Food is always fresh and never disappointing. Fajitas are always a good choice and when you order the fresh guac, they'll prepare it at your table! It's like dinner and a show! Will definitely be back whenever I'm in town!"
"I recently visited Pieology for the first time with friends recently and was really pleased with the selection and taste of the pies. For a set price you can pick your crust, base sauce and toppings, regardless of the amount and variety. The pizzas are made to order and placed in the oven for maybe 5-10 minutes.  There are gluten-free options as well for those that need.    Overall I'd have to say I'm a fan of Pieology now and will return in the future.  Staff is friendly and efficient. It was a relatively quiet late afternoon so the wait was negligible.  Check it out."
"I've eaten at this location twice. The first time I got a falafel to go. I thought the cilantro was a bit much for the falafel, it wasn't what I've been used to in the past. I like a milder basic falafel. Today I had a shawarma pita and it was really good. A little heavy on the red onions so next time I plan to ask for no onions! The price is great for the amount of good you get. My pita's are always loaded up."
Had a good protein omlete. Flavorful food and staff was friendly. I will go back and try some of the other dishes.
"Please do not eat at this place, I'm scared of this food. The worst part is the service and the trashy, anti-family, anti-american atmosphere. Please stay away"
Delicious oatmeal raisin cookie. Cute little spot and decor. Nice little place to sit and chat over coffee or lunch.
"This place is the best. My friends and I get takeout from here all the time, and it's great because I can exercise my total indecision right up to choosing food, because they have sooooooo many choices. Thai? Vietnamese? Chinese? Sushi? Tottie's has it all, and it is ALL delicious. Sugar Cane Chicken? Pho? Pad Thai? What are you in the mood for!? The prices are pretty reasonable and the portions are decent, not overwhelming, but everything is flavorful and distinctive."
"way overrated, owner and manager have a seriously lousy attitude. Overpriced for sure. Bumpers is the place to go for the crab legs, not mushy like Pickle Bills. They have the river right outside the place so they feel they can justify the increased pricing."
Food was pretty good however the prices are high. Waitress did a great job until she asked if I needed change.
"Holy ""Made fresh at your table"" Guacamole!!!  My heart skips a beat just thinking about it.  Tex-Mex fine dining... at it's finest. Also an important note:  One of my top five places to drink a house margarita."
"As a long-time fan of Chick-fil-A, I wasn't walking in expecting to be comparing the two. But as we ordered, sat down, and were served, I couldn't help it. The service is as good, if not better here than at CFA. The sauces are better, and so is the chicken! Everything was very clean and we were thoroughly impressed. I would like more sandwich options--I think next time I'll just be getting chicken strips because I ended up eating just the chicken off my pimento crunch sandwich. Very impressed!!!"
"Very disappointing, the price is too expensive for the food quality.   First of all, there is no green tea or red bean  ice cream on the menu.   They only have ice cream bar, and it is only one per person, on the menu, they didn't say that is limited. Secondly, way too much rice on the sushi. I guess thats how they make the money. Lastly, the ipad service is stupid. you have to wait for someone to confirm it. Overall, not a good reataurant for sushi."
"Pretty much the same food you can get at every other Panda Express across the country - quick-serve Chinese.  Nothing wrong with it, but nothing grand either.  The good news is that it wasn't going to slow down our trip, nor was it going to set us back a ridiculous amount either."
Great food. Try the chop its huge.friendly service and down home atmosphere.
"There was hair in our food and drinks - multiple times!  We had to send out food and drinks back 3 different times.   We were about 10 deep in out party.  2 booths seated directly next to each other. One table ordered chicken tacos.  The minute the server sat the plate down we noticed there was hair in it.  She took it right back.   One of our Margaritas came out immediately after .. there was a long strain of hair floating on top.  The server took it right away and apologized - again.  The other table ordered nachos .. and guess what ... hair was it ... stuck in the Queso.  This time the server stood there and waited until we looked over the nachos.  We both noticed the hair.  He said WOW!  You guys see it's not my hair (he had a short brown cut with a cap on).   He again, returned the nachos and we decided not to order anything else.    I'll never return!"
"Great place for a smaller breakfast, and pretty great coffee as well."
The most important thing for a restaurant is food safety and clean. See what I got from my dish. Other bugs maybe still forgivable. But cockroach means this restaurant is really dirty nasty and not take their kitchen clean job seriously.
"My wife and I participated in the MS Walk and decided it was the perfect opportunity to give the famous River Cafe a try.  What a beautiful spot and a great ambience.  We were greeted by a couple friendly hostesses and shown to an indoor table as the patio was full.  We got a great spot by the window that opened, so a great compromise. The experience.  The menu did not have a lot of lunch options (brunch was the focus of the day) and the ones that were offered were somewhat difficult to figure out.  Frustrated I ordered the bison burger and my wife had the flatbread.  The food came quickly enough (wasn't busy) but that is where it all went awry.  The bison burger was small yet I could not finish it as there was a strange flavour to it that made it sickening after a while.  The potato salad that accompanied it was good. The flat bread was not good.  There must have been something wrong with it as it had a sweet but pungent smell (and taste) to it.  We are not ones to complain but when the server finally returned (no quality check, and did not see her until we were done with the place) my wife mentioned it was a little weird. The server did concur that something seemed off and promptly took the item off the bill which was appreciated, but also expected as it was not edible. Overall I am glad we went because we had been wondering about this place but I would be very hesitant to go back."
"Best barbecue this side of the Mississippi!!!! Come here your car washed and detailed pick up some Petroleum, and slap your lips around the best barbecue you've had in Arizona!!! Hot diggity !!!"
"Great and fresh food (had filet mignon and asparagus), quick and friendly service, and warm atmosphere are the reasons for my 5 star rating.  They were very busy for 9pm on a Tuesday night so the locals love it.  The bar area is good for dining too.  TV's with Baseball playoffs were good for entertainment."
"We checked this place out for dinner during race weeks. It was alllright. Ordered the ""thunder thighs"" - which sounded like buffalo wings made w chicken thighs, but ended up w regular wings. Not sure if we got the wrong order or if they are just called thighs when they are wings. Either way I was disappointed, but the wings were pretty decent after I got over the sadness.  At our table we had a chicken sandwich, a sausage and pepper hoagie, and a pork chop. The chicken was reported as good (wasn't mine), the pork was Ok but not out of this world, and the sausage was messy but good - had marinara sauce on it which was unexpected. The mac and cheese was a little greasy but pretty good.  As for the ""biker bar"" label.. I saw about 2 bikers and the rest of the crowd was regular peeps. The girls wear skimpy outfits so its not a family place for sure.   It was ok, but I'm not dying to go back right away."
"To whomever owns Lucki Thai:   Lucki is actually spelled with a y.   Sheesh, how embarrassing.   Beyond the (yes, I do realize it was intentional) misspelling of the name of the restaurant, Lucki Thai doesn't miss on many marks for me.  I've had the opportuniti to dine in, get carri out, and order deliveri (I'll stop this now) from Lucki on many occasions in the last few months, so I can tell you that no matter which method you decide to go with for your thai food fix there you won't be disappointed.  The first time I had Lucki I dined in and had the Tom Yum soup with Shrimp and their Crab Fried rice.  The Tom Yum Soup is consistently good, and I'd know since it's been a staple of every single order I've made with Lucki since.  It's always hot, with the perfect combination of sour and spicy, and loaded with mushrooms and an ample amount of shrimp.  The large order feeds 2 perfectly.  The crab fried rice is not something I tend to order, but Lucki's version definitely packed a lot of crab flavor.   They also weren't shy with the egg on the rice, and being an egg slut like Anthony Bourdain, that pleased me.  I've done a mix of delivery and take-out many times since, and every time the delivery is at the house by the promised time (usually well before), and the food has almost always been ready to go when I arrive for a carry-out order.    Of the items I've ordered those times, the curries have been phenomenal, as has the spicy eggplant entree.   I wish I could explain what makes the eggplant there stand out over other places that I've had similar dishes, but I usually gobble it up so fast there's no time for me to remember any particulars about the dish other than it's absolutely delectable.  I'm also a huge fan of their brown rice option, even though it's $2 extra.   Lucki's brown rice is one of the only in the city that I feel is worth whatever upcharge they want for it.   I'm pretty sure it's not just brown rice but a mix of wild and brown rice.   I also really liked the Rad Na, though my laziness knows no bounds in that I felt like it was a lot of work eating it.   It's truly shameful.     The only order I wasn't completely thrilled with so far was the Beef Pad See Ewe.  The flavors were nice, but the beef was tough and chewy.   A simple misstep which I can forgive.  I have to admit I almost gave 4 stars instead of 5 for the only thing that has gotten on my nerves a bit with Lucki Thai thus far:   spice consistency.   I started by ordering level 6 and 7 which is my normal go-to at other Thai joints, but didn't find them spicy enough.   I've now settled on an 8, which at most places would feel like it was burning a hole in my esophagus with each swallow.   Getting delivery a few weeks ago and ordering an 8, it had literally ZERO spice.  It actually might have gotten into the negatives.   It's quite frustrating because I suspect if I move into the 9-10 category the chef stops even paying attention and probably just dumps a whole barrel of ghost chiles into the pan.   WHAT'S MY NEXT MOVE HERE?  But alas, the service and food are simply too good even with that inconsistenci.  Sorry I couldn't resist."
"The food was great!  When we walked in,  only one dark haired guy greeted us and I said it was our first time in to which he said nothing.  Then we ordered 3 salads,  4 meatballs,  one cheesy bread and one order of 4 canolis to go.  The order took about 25 mins to fill. We sat at an old card table that appeared to be in need of replacement.  Two chairs only so we grabbed another for our third person.  Leaving room only for two tables with one chair each.  Then we used the restroom which wasn't clean at although tp was provided.  While the same guy who took our order prepared our food another customer came in and stood probably five mins for the guy making the food to come out and give our order.  The customer left as no one came out to get his order.  Then we finally got our food brought out in plastic to go containers.  The salads were delicious in spite of the dry chicken.  All the dressing was in small individual servings that you had to open. The meatballs were fantastic and moist.  Best I've had.  The cheesy bread was also delicious.  The dining room was very small and I think it's geared towards pick up and take out mostly.  Not an enjoyable environment for dinner.  Great food. Though I would only get takeout.  When I eat in, I like real plates and silverware.  Also,  nice to get appetizer before main course instead of after.  Food was good.  One star for dining room experience."
"Yum! I could eat it every day. My favorite is the ""special"" burro.  My second would have to be the two tacos. Beef or chicken, both delicious. Affordable, quick, and take some tortillas home for later."
"Mexican cafe with lively atmosphere and decent pricing.   This place was not at all what I expected from the outside. I used to come here when it was a place called M. It was totally totally different then.  Anyway, it's now a very very bright and colorful Mexican cafe.   Enchiladas with Boom Boom Sauce and Mango Margaritas were good. I think I'd like to come back in summer and sit on the huge patio. Really good Tres Leches cake too.  I just can't get over the interior though - I think the lighting is just SO BRIGHT, they would do themselves a favor to get a lighting scheme designer to come in and adjust things a bit - make it less of a cafeteria. It reminds me of a place in California - Chevy's... same sort of set up and theme.   Lots of families and kids. No sense of intimacy - so not a date spot for sure - a good casual place to chill after shopping at the Pottery Barn though..   The server we had was a little sleepy but he was nice. I think he needed a nap though."
"This is one of the best ""hole in the wall"" spots I've been to in years! Fresh home-made tortillas, great steak, people are amazing! I came with a party of 10 ppl and the food was fast, delicious and prefer was perfect. I will definitely be back!"
"Their specialty dishes are very unique.  The spicy tuna nachos are amazing. Some of my favorites are: lemon roll and the edamame is a must.  For desert also try the chocolate chip cookie with fudge and vanilla ice cream - yummy We celebrated a birthday in the Tatami room.  Beautiful private room, we sat on cushions  in a very cozy setting."
Wow! What a great sub. All of them are fantastic.I especially like the rosemary bun. The staff are alway great too and  have a up beat and positive attitude. Perfect for a quick lunch.
"I've had their ""Cleveland's"" breakfast many times and it is perfect every time. The best eggs and sausage breakfast in town. I don't know how they do it, but their scrambled eggs are the best I've ever had. I've tried to duplicate it at home without success. I get the same thing every time I go. Scrambled eggs with sausage, potatoes and toast with a side of Guinness. Yum!"
"Great Parathas. A little pricey. The service could be better. But, going into an Indian fast-food place, I had a very low expectation. The place wasn't so clean, but oh well. The food made up for it. We went back three times during our 6 days trip to Vegas."
Alway stop when we're in town. Amazing fresh food. Really good prices. Friendly  service.  Drink menu has a good variety as well.
"Two thumbs up!!!!  Pho (soup) and their Banh Minhs (sandwiches) are to die for!!! Not to mention their Chinese Food choices!!!! This place is a hole in the wall but their food choices are awesome!!!  Located 5 miles from the airport, no traffic, parking is not a problem either!!!!  The staff are courteous and gets your order right!!!"
"Fresher noodles you may not find in this town, I tried the steamed vegetable dumplings and the chicken noodle soup - loved it! But careful the portions are big but the staff box it nicely and it still that's great next day :) Also the mango bubble tea was tasty."
The draft beer selection is great the tapas style menu is a perfect match and the upstairs is a great after work gathering place. But the best thing about this place is the bartender named Siti (sp) he is one of the best in Charlotte.
"Excellent ramen and one of the best restaurants in Charlotte. Very small area and limited seating, so arrive early or be ready to wait. Recommend all the bowls, sake flights, and be sure to get green tea ice cream."
Had an awesome breakfast cum brunch.  Staff is very warm and courteous and delicious food
"Fresh and quality sashimi and great lunch time prices.  I tried it for lunch once and I am a fan, there are few quality Japanese restaurants in the city but this is amazing (even though it's Korean owned) and great value for the money.  Great decor and swift service."
"Great ambience and decor! And the food is delicious. Pan fried fish, street side Indian noodles, hongkong chicken are a few names to start with !"
Ice cream is ok.   To Pricey.  Bought two cones and was charged $20.00 for a cone and ONE SCOOP!  First and most likely our last time.  There are other places with great flavors and very reasonable prices.
One of my favorite breakfast place to go to with my high school son. He loves the food. We both love a good breakfast joint.
"We went here for the 1st time this evening and really enjoyed it - great ambiance, delicious food with amazing flavors, and good service. We really liked the fresh roll, spring rolls, dumplings, wild curry (good spice!), and basil chicken. They served healthy portions. Cash only & BYOB. We will definitely return!"
"My husband and I ordered our wedding cake here. We saw this beautiful white 3 tiered pyramid shaped cake in a then really big Julia Robert's movie and really wanted that one. We went in to Baker Wee to see if they could make it. The owners were not there and we were told by the manager lady we spoke to that she will be the one making the cake anyway. She saw the movie too and knew exactly what cake we were asking for. We even made a 2D drawing of it, she wrote down her notes and took the order. She said she will rent the movie so she can take one more look at it before she makes it. Fast forward to our wedding day....we arrived at the restaurant where our dinner reception was and for the first time we got to see our cake. WOW! We almost fainted. I should include pictures because there's just no way to describe how ugly it was. The original agreement in size was a 12"" x 12"" square and 10-12"" tall, like I said pyramid. We got an 8"" square base, next layer 6"" base and the top layer 4"" base and the whole cake was 2 feet tall! It looked like a Chinese pagoda. The layers were on 4"" tall sticks. And the best part: it was airbrushed with brown color like marble and had brown 1/2"" diameter ball on the top.. -   Turned out, the owner (who has never seen the movie - or apparently a pyramid before ) ended up making the cake, never called us or the manager lady with questions, just tried to figure it out from the her notes. This was her understanding of it.  We were so embarrassed all night, everyone kept asking what the cake was supposed to be? We just kept saying: a snow white pyramid. Next morning we drove down to the bakery, furious. She said she will not refund the $300 we spent on it because she worked on it all day and she did her best. She said she was sorry and we can have a basic cake ($30 value) for free. We did get that cake a few week later for a birthday and never ever returned to Baker Wee again. It's very sad how greatly it impacted our special day. We should have demanded a refund but we gave up on the arguing back and fourth - it didn't change anything. After all we didn't want the money, we wanted the cake. So anyway, I would not recommend them if they were the last bakery, I  would rather make a homemade cake. I also wish there was a way to choose 0 stars on this on."
"We chose this place to split lunch and it was an excellent choice. Waiter was very enthusiast and funny. Had a good beer selection (mostly bottles) which was refreshing after much walking. BLT fried green tomato appetizer is a must have. We split the blue plate for our meal. Watermelon was tasty, chicken as well. Chicken wasn't anything special for me, but I am by no means a fried chicken expert. Only downfall was restaurant was a bit dark for lunch."
"Enjoyed Nee House immensely. No service issues, just fantastic chinese food. Food order? Spicy Green Beans = Perfect!, Chow Fun (Chicken) = Perfect!   Just a great place. Perhaps my expectations were set by all the bad service reviews, but I was not disappointed."
In town for a convention and looking for something away from the strip. Found this place on Yelp and was not disappointed. Mango margaritas were tasty as were the shrimp tacos. The waiter mistakenly brought me the fish tacos (which were actually quite good as well) and was very apologetic when I pointed this out. He then replaced them as quickly as possible.
Had a 30 minute wait.. But played foosball (sow) to pass the time!   The brisket nacho were really good!   The bacon Mac-n-cheese burger was good but not great!  The Motley Cue sandwich was rally good. Lots of mean.. Could probably split between 2 people  The wings.. Cutest presentation.   Staff was eh.. I mean the place is busy. No time to be too friendly to all the damn tourist. Can't say that I blame them.   Neat experience. Def worth a trip..   Next time will def try the desert.. This time we were too full!
"Got a chance to check out this spot while catching up with a business contact for coffee.  The gentleman working this morning was patient in explaining their offerings .  The coffee was smooth and only needed a bit of almond milk - kudos to the cafe for having that as an available option.    I had the pleasure of enjoying the croissant, it had the right amount of flakiness and was bigger than expected.  The atmosphere was casual and laid back.  I now look forward to trying this place out later in the day."
"Gorgeous hotel! I felt like a VIP. Definitely the next best thing to the real Venice, in my opinion. Lots of pools to choose from and great casino. Convenient location- close to everything. Would definitely go there again."
"Yes! As good as it gets in way of pinball machines! My parents and I had so much fun crossing this one off the bucket list. Plus we each got to take a walk down memory lane looking at all the machines. We loved how each machine told the history, year, etc. Keep up the good work pinballers!"
"The Venetian is a beautiful hotel! So many cool and fun things to see or do! I got a suite and the room was huge! The only reason for the 4 is because the room service food was not too great and there were some items left from the previous guests in the room, which tells me that room service does not do a thorough job."
"After agonizing over where to have our one upscale meal in Montreal, we decided on Chez L'epicier.  We were glad we did.  We did the tasting menu will wine pairings (note that 2 courses do not come paired) and our ""journey"" included a savory macaroon amuse bouche, gazpacho, gnocci, cod, goose, foix gras, and more.  The tastes were small but hearty, most with a delicious inventive sauce.  The wines were great and ran the gamut of classic French wines, and were well paired.    The service was perfectly paced, with our server prepping our next course and pouring wine, and another server serving and explaining each dish.  We were able to get a same day reservation on a Monday night.  The space was about 3/4 full, and the meal took 2.5 hours due to the numerous tastings and relaxed pace.  The decor is modern chic, and there is a bar area to do bites/drinks.    Dress code - you will not feel out of place if you aren't in a jacket - but I'd recommend making this your dress up night."
"I have been to ChuChai 5 times now. Trust me on this, get the sticky rice and the crispy duck! I would have given them 5 stars but the last time I was there, the food arrived cold and we asked them to reheat it. It came back to the table just as cold the second time.  The patio is a great people-watching spot in the summer plus it's bring your own wine which helps keep the cost down seeing as it is a tad overpriced."
"I love this place.  I admit I am stuck on the Old Fashioned Turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce.  This is real fresh roast turkey (I think roasted daily but not sure) on great wheat bread, the sauce has just a bit of a bite and compliments the sandwich well.  Huge helping of turkey.    The setting is in an old pecan grove with mature trees, and grass.  A very relaxed kind of place to just enjoy the Phoenix weather the food and those you are with.  It closes during the Summer and I can't wait for it to open back up in the Fall.  The perfect ending however, are the deserts.  They are all hommade, and terrific.  I can't get past the pecan pie, perhaps the best in Phoenix.  The crust is just right flaky, and it's loaded with pecans.  I'm hungry again just writing this review"
"It was a lonely cold evening and the roads were slick from the rain that was pouring down...  NOT!   Actually to tell you the truth it was a bright, hot & sunny day [like usual in Vegas] and my great aunt and uncle were visiting. Needed a quick, and close restaurant to grub at. Mexican food sounded good..  Hey, look its Viva Mercados!  [my aunt] so you've been there?!  [me] No.. but lets try it.  Walking in the decor was the usual.. whats the word.. oh yes.. Festive. But then again thats what you find at every mexican restaurant.  The hostess sat us quickly. 1 star for that. lets just state.. I HATE WAITING. especially if the place isn't busy.   Quick, friendly service. Lady explained to us the specials and what different words meant that i hadn't heard before. Add, 1 more star.  Didn't try the chips, salsa or bean dip. I'm just not one to fill up on that stuff then take two bites of my food. No, i wanted to have a empty stomach for my meal so that i could write about my experience. [yes, i know im just brilliant, no need for the pat on the back]  The food came and it was hot. It was delicious, mostly cause i was starving.. but it wasn't something that was spectacular. My mother in law makes better beans and rice. The taco cracked as soon as i took a bite. Thats another pet peeve. Inside I cried a little.. Now all the meat cheese and lettuce was going to fall out. Well, that ruined my taco experience. Boo. The chile relleno was delish. Cooked to perfections and de-seeded, just the way I like it. Adding 1 more star just for the chile relleno. Overall it was good  Would have given it another star but this place is way over priced. Can we say expensive. Especially because this place isn't on the strip. Their prices are the same as Gonzalez Y Gonzalez and they're portions aren't as big or as good. Sorry Viva Mercados, I will not be coming back."
"Food was OK. Nothing special. Its tastes like frozen food. I had the chicken breast over veggies, and my son had a southwest wrap. I think the best part was the sauces they use. The smoothie is just some concentrated mix, no real fruit. Not my cup o tea. This is a family ran joint. Which is fine, but how I found out it was family owned and operated was not fine. Scene- Husband and wife arguing about daily duties and how they cant keep doing ""this"" every day. Along with the wife grilling (no pun intended) her daughter about letting the dog out, homework and so on. I wasn't eves dropping, they were standing 10 feet away from my table. It was hard not to hear. Leave that stuff at home. Nobody wants to hear it."
"I admit that I haven't tried ALL the italian restaurants in Toronto... but of the ones that I have tried, Ciao has been the place that I've gone to multiple times.   Why? Let me count the ways: 1. Reserved table is always ready  2. Amazing service 3. Fabulous Wine Selection 4. The patio feels so European in the Summer 5. The portions are huge! 6. The quality and taste of the food is amaze 7. It's in Yorkville - the perfect locale for a quaint after dinner walk 8. The olives with the bread - delish!  I feel like there's probably a lot more reasons - but I also feel like this is enough to make you want to check it out for yourself!  ps. Be sure to order the Mushroom Risotto - it's divine!!"
"OPH all over this country is amazing. I've enjoyed them in Minneapolis, Chicago, LA and Seattle.  I cannot believe how bad this location is and I hate that this is the only location in the valley of the sun.  Please... someone... open another franchise somewhere else in this valley.. PLEASE!"
"This place is definitely a local spot. We stumbled in on Friday around 7pm to a karaoke night! Everyone seemed to know one another and felt like family (some may have actually been family. It was so intimate they even celebrated the monthly birthdays and sang to a woman with a birthday crown on. Definitely felt like a regular karaoke group that returns each week. Everyone welcomed us, even new people that came in said hello and told us about the karaoke nights and to come back again soon. Despite the closeness of the patrons we didn't feel like an outsider.   Food: You go and order at the counter and then sit and they will bring it to you. The woman at the counter was very friendly and helped us making our decisions. They have a wide variety of items including ice cream, coffee, desserts, salads, sandwiches, breakfast, tea, etc. Very reasonably priced menu! I got the tuna melt, it was just ok. The tuna salad was a bit too over dressed for my liking. It felt gluttonous with all the mayonnaise and I think there was mustard in there maybe? It came with a side and I chose coleslaw, it felt kind of like the kind you would buy in a big jar at sam's club, not my favorite but others like their sides so maybe I'll try something else next time. The others liked the chips and the macaroni salad. Chicken salad on the croissant had similar opinions on the tuna that it was thick and over dressed but the croissant was toasted and good.  I would definitely check this place out again, maybe for breakfast next time! I love that they do reward cards for locals to earn free sandwiches and even deliver within a 5 mile radius. I'll update after my next visit."
Hands down the best place to eat in Vegas! The food is priced well and the food is delicious! I would have eaten here everyday if I'd known this place was here! My wife absolutely loves this place as well. Service was awesome which is s bonus!
"Good prices here, huge pancakes available.  The place is a bit ""breakfast diner""ish, which is fine since it is a breakfast diner.  My only probelm is that our server seemed a little impatient.  The service was fine, but could use a little more friendliness.    Anyways, this place is nothing special.  But if you're in the area, try it out and you'll get exactly what you expect when you're walking in.  No big surprises here.   Derek"
"I won't go back. Food was, at best, mediocre in flavor and texture. If I ate the shrimp blindfolded I wouldn't have been able to tell you it was shrimp. This place used to have great Chinese food but apparently not any more."
"This is a hidden gem , the decor is a bit dated but the pizza is awesome. I'm from Chicago were pizza is King and Pizzafarros is my favorite in Scottsdale!!!"
"Reservation = walk in.  Pointless to make reservations.  We made a reservation the day before for 11:00am the next day morning. When we arrived we are not being served but was asked to wait.  This is  pointless for reservation, as at the same time they still take walk in and people who has reservation is under the same queue with the walk in.  After 30min, we asked how much longer will be the wait? The lady answered ""no idea, I don't know"". Avoid this restaurant."
"The first & most important thing you need to know is this place is NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY, leave the kids at home because they are certainly not welcomed...they're allowed inside but make sure they leave any kind of expression of joy at the door before entering.   Second thing to know, INDOOR VOICES ONLY. Whispered excitement guarantees you won't be asked to leave. Yes, it's a pinball arcade, but it's a ""MUSEUM"" pinball hall of fame.   Third & last thing (I think) to know is not to expect favorable employee characteristics. At least not from the guy with the gray ponytail...especially not from him actually, maybe just avoid all contact with him if possible.   Once you understand those 3 essential things you are sure to enjoy your time. With rows of pinball machines there is plenty to check out, the variety is not lacking. You can certainly stretch $10-20 into a good couple hours worth of play.   Duck Hunt is the biggest tease....NEVER in working order when I'm there."
"Don't expect to order sweet and sour anything. This place is a bit more authentic than the average Canuck might like.   It's also tucked away off Davis Drive and off Harry Walker so the only way to find it is to look behind the hotel.   The noodle dishes are great, and the Pad Thai is less sweet and more interesting than usual. Portions can be a bit on the small side, but so is the dining room.   I have been back a few times so far, and this won't be the last time. It has room to grow on me, and so does the rating.   Let me be clear: this food tastes much better than Mandarin, but is less mainstream than the late Chitose. Newmarket is so desolate in the ""good Chinese food"" category that Cambodian Noodle King is my go to when I can't justify a drive to Markham."
"My first time visiting Sabor today and all I can say is what an absolute spectacular culinary experience! Their Latin Street food was fresh and very, very tasty. The Empanadas were perfectly cooked and juicy, not dry at all. The street corn, which is a favorite of mine, was the best I have had so far. I can highly recommend their shrimp and steak tacos which were soft and had great flavor. We ordered sliced avocado, creamy cold quacamole and together with the rosa sauce and fresh lime on the side made for a meal levels above what we paid for or expected. I love that you have so many choices to choose from to make up a meal that will satisfy any food cravings or preferences you might have and it is fresh and clean. On top of this the staff is friendly and very helpful. Such a joy! My kids loved this perfect little addition to Davidson as well and I can definitely see us becoming regulars."
"The tonkatsu ramen with black garlic oil, nori, and extra tamago is amazing. Definitely add the black garlic oil, it's a must! Everything here is prepared fresh and from scratch. It's definitely worth coming back to. Customer service is excellent and we truly loved our experience. The chefs are super helpful and they really care about their customers. It's a simple place with a small menu but their ramen is delicious. The noodles are freshly made as well as their pork. The soft boiled egg is perfectly made and isn't overly seasoned. I would recommend coming here."
"OK, my first yelp review, so bear with me. I tend to break things down into categories, so I'll go with that for now. Atmosphere: Confusing. Decor is kinda kitschy, supposedly to evoke dinner at mom's or something of that order. Yeah, if you have really loud obnoxious relatives; maybe it's due to the construction of the space, but the place was LOUD! For the price (more about that later), this is a special-occasion restaurant for most of us, but I wouldn't recommend it for an romantic/intimate one.  Service: No complaints here. Our server (Eric, I believe) was extremely pleasant and most helpful. He took the time to explain some of the menu items, checked on us fairly often, and  was generally very friendly. High marks here. Food (quality): Again, very few complaints. Food was fresh and flavorful; portions, while not huge, were pretty satisfying. My wife had the roasted beet salad (actually part of the 4-course special but our server told us we could order it a la carte) and enjoyed it very much. I started with the Caesar...the black garlic dressing was delicious! Highly recommended!  My wife's filet mignon was well prepared and presented; I had the brick oven chicken and was very pleased. Moist, tasty, and the mac & cheese was excellent. Topped off with the Brookie for dessert, a very nice meal. Food (value): And here's why I tend to shun trendy restaurants. A cocktail, a glass of wine, a beer, 2 salads, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert: just this side of $140. Brief breakdown: the beer, although a John Smith from England, was served out of a can! Some may call this ""ironic""; I say, ""tacky!"" The aforementioned beet salad? A few pieces of beet, a little arugula, a dollop of ricotta...$14! And although my chicken was very good, one medium-sized chicken breast doesn't warrant a price over $20. And before the Summerlin crowd starts chanting ""Go back to Denny's"", I'm talking value, not price. My last two steakhouse meals (Silverado and Circus Circus) were each about $30 less for a comparable meal. So, all in all, good, not great, and not worth the price."
"Ok, this place had us right from the start. My wife just finished  running a marathon and was extremely cold. Seeing her shiver, our waiter brought her a cup of homemade chicken vegetable soup on the house. Who does that these days?  The service really was great. From start to finish. The food was excellent. It was standard fare for a grill but you can tell those that prepared it really cared.   I had the LA wrap and my wife had more soup. Both were really good. They make fresh, homemade soup every day.   I'll be back. You should give them a try too."
"The service is always sweet, nothing too spectacular happening with the food. They do make the place very cheery and comforting which isn't easy for the space they're working with.  It's a good casual spot for drinks and munchies in a cute neighborhood but nothing to write home about on a normal day."
"I've been here 10+ times now and each time the service has been excellent. They have slowed down a little since the grand opening like most places do which to me has only allowed them to improve.  I will continue to frequent this convenient location.   The quality of the food is still great and there's nothing hidden about how it's prepared. While you wait in line to order you can view openly where they prepare the food, so you know it's clean and up to standards.   No complaints here!"
"Frybread is good, but there isn't enough substance. I got some watered down beans, hardly any ground beef and mostly lettuce."
"I've never had a bad experience here.  delivery, pickup, whatever, the food always turns out good, for me.  Yesterday they were my saving grace, when Papa John's let me down SEVERELY.  Pizza Hut quoted me an hour-ish wait time (which is fine when I know about it, not when i'm promised 30-40 minutes and it ends up being over an hour like PJ's was)...and they were there at my house with my piping hot, delicous pizza in about 25 minutes.  LOVE."
"I will say that the unsalted edemame was not expected or appreciated. A friend who lived in Japan says unsalted is the default, but isn't the way I prefer. The crab legs were not great either, but crab legs are not what brought me to this buffet, it was the opportunity to eat an irresponsible amount of sushi and then be able to complain about it on the Internet if they asked me to exercise even a bit of discretion. They did not interrupt my my unrestrained gluttony. I appreciated this at the time, but I wonder how they sleep at night watching gastronomic self destruction shift after shift.  I thought the sushi was pretty good. I went in the afternoon (paying dinner buffet price) on the weekend. The selection was pretty good, and every time I returned, there was more stuff. It really surprised me that they had sashimi, which was well cut. They had a good variety of sashimi, and only one was strong (but I dont remember ... maybe the hamachi?). The rolls were rolled well, too.  As for freshness, only what I think was the hamachi was maybe off. I am sure it depends on when you go. I tipped the guys working the buffet (as well as my server) because I thought they were good enough to warrant it.  The service was friendly. I thought it was weird that drinks come in massive beer steins, which do not exactly mesh with the contemporary Asian fusion decor, which is classy and understated.  There was a group there (I think it was somebody's birthday or engagement or something) and it was clear that this is a good place for a group of people to go.  If you want to eat a lot of sushi, or want to go to a restaurant with a variety of Asian dishes, plus a lot of sushi that is not expensive, this is a good choice. I wish it wasn't in bumblefuck South Kankakee, and I hope that the location doesn't deep-six the place, but I will be back."
"I'm very surprised that after 20+ reviews this place has a 4 1/2 average rating.  First off, so you don't think I'm some elitist bastard, let me state that I happily eat food at IHOP and Denny's.   Anyway, so as I was with a bunch of college friends last weekend in Vegas, apparently eating at The Peppermill was a MUST?!? The decor of the place with it's bright neon rainbow purplish lights was a felt like a cross between Denny's and a Strip Club..I don't really dig that kind've ambience unless i'm actually in a strip club...     Service was okay nothing really stood out as good or bad, and prices are actually good for being on the strip and having burgers around $9-10 and steaks  are like $25 (although i'd rather spend $5-10 more and go to a legit steakhouse).      So why 2 stars? well..the food absolutely sucked.  I ordered a Swiss mushroom burger w/curly fries.  First off, the burger and curly fries LOOKED delicious..but upon eating my food..I found absolutely no taste in any of the food, even after adding tons of salt and pepper to it. It's as if some mixture of oil and plastic got in my food that negated anything that could add taste to my food. Plus the mayo I got came in this bowl and let's say something about it's color and texture didn't look right.   Anyway, the service and price were okay, decor a little dirty feeling for my taste. But what really killed it was that the food lacked any taste at all. Save your money and go to In & Out Burger at the other end of the strip, or even Burger King much closer at O'Sheas. ~G"
"Ordered 2 coffee, and two breakfast croissant sandwich for me and bf.   The croissant was very tasty but the size is tiny....so it's quite expensive for the size.  I would like to return but I probably will need to order two just for myself and it would be too expensive for breakfast :("
"Located at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas. Great service, fast or slow depending on how busy it is. I ordered beef/broccoli, chicken chow mein soft noodles, & a small wonton soup. I didn't like the green bell pepper in the chow mein (next time I will order without it). Today, I ordered a noodle soup with chicken and vegetables. Definitely, hit the spot. I added some soy sauce and chili for flavor. One of my favorite chinese restaurants'."
"Never had a problem at this one until today. Guess they were to busy to care about the quality of their food. I ordered my regular Asiago ranch spicy chicken sandwich. Got my food at the window I always do a quality check no matter what, looked at my sandwich and it had honey mustard on it, last time I checked honey mustard and ranch were two different things. So I sent it back, the girl who made it came to the window and argued that it was made correctly. I said no, because Asiago ranch isn't yellow and doesn't taste like honey mustard.  She said I know I made it right I said ok, well I don't want it. So she took it back brought me another one this time a regular chicken sandwich with a ranch packet. Yeah I paid 7 dollars for a ranch packet with a chicken sandwich. Sweet girl right, nasty attitude to boot. So I took it into the store this time, and the manager showed me the ranch in the bottle that was suppose to be on my sandwich and remade it. Wow imagine that someone who new how to make it without attitude. I'm still very disappointed money is money no matter where you spend it at. And I expect to get what I ask for with my money. Not something you just feel like free styling."
"We had my Mother's Birthday Party here on 10/29/16. What a Great time we all had. The food, music and waiters were Great!!! Thanks Lyles!!!"
I love this place... it's great to have a neighborhood center with good food and great coffee!!  The patio is great all year long.
"I was treated to lunch here and even for a free lunch it was not satisfying.  First my french onion soup had very little flavor, almost watered down.  The cheese was overcooked and clumping and the bread was just... bread in my soup.  I had the short ribs for my entree.  The ribs where extremely dry and overcooked.  The portions are small and the meat was so inedible that I didn't even finish my meal.  What flavor that was infused was just sauce cooked onto the meat and no flavor from the meat itself.  I was extremely disappointed.  My guess is that they garner the majority of their business from out of towners staying in the hotel it is connected to.  This will definitely not be in my lunch rotation downtown."
I love NY city pizza pie.  Excellent rendition of sharing a portion of NY here in the desert.
"Last time I was in this area at lunch time, Chao was still being built. Now it's open and today was my first official visit to check things out. I've only tried one entree from the menu, but if the other choices are anything like what I ate today I will definitely be a regular here.  I tried the Pad Kee Mao with chicken. If you don't know what this is, it consists of rice noodles, onion, Thai basil, chili, a little bell pepper and a slice of tomato in there somewhere - all covered in spicy brown sauce. The flavor of this entree was amazing - definitely something I will order again. One of my co-workers decided to eat light and ordered the chicken satay, which he also enjoyed.  Service here was great - Brian took good care of us. They seem to be doing well since they opened. Decent crowd at lunch, but not too packed. I like the layout inside - and the fact that they have a bar means I will definitely be visiting Chao in the near future for happy hour.  Updates to follow after I visit here a few more times!"
A little pricey but worth it! Crepes were delicious! We got the seafood and chicken pesto. Really cute back area and service was good. Would come back!
My husband brought me here for our 2nd year anniversary and I love the ambience of this place.  That includes the music and environment.  The food was amazing.  We ordered the truffle fries and it was great!!!  I ordered the spicy seafood pasta and my husband ordered the amazing chicken and rice au gratin.  The cocktails were awesome and we had a great night.  The service was fast and the waiter was very pleasant to talk to.  It wasn't pricey either which was a surprise given the amazing service there.  This is a definite go!
"If there are two things I like, they are eating and drinking. And gastropubs really let me do both at the same time very well. So they're already on a good footing with me.  Gaspar is a very nice place inside. It has a cozy, warm feeling, with its dim (but not too dim) interior, exposed brick and wood. Tip: you can get in either on Rue de la Commune or Rue Saint Paul, or through the hotel to which it is attached.  Both times I came I sat at the bar, and received excellent and friendly service. The first time it was Monday evening, and it was dead (and late November...and cold outside). I had the (BBQ Bourbon Bacon) Burger (that's a lot of Bs). While it was cooked more than I'd have liked (I wasn't asked how I wanted it done, and didn't think to specify...stupid me!) it still tasted very good. Cooked a bit less it could be a top 20 burger for me. I also subbed fries out for cheesy mashed taters (no extra charge) and they were yummy too. Oh, and I had a pint of beer, which was beery good.  Second visit, Thursday night and the place was much more hopping. There was live music, drink specials and a generally good vibe in the place. I had steak frites, which was cooked to the medium I specified (I was asked this time) and good, though not exceptional. The fries (aka frites) were very good. The highlight of the meal, believe it or not, was the pea soup which was so good I almost licked the bowl when I finished! You can bet I'll be ordering that again next time I'm there. Oh, and I had a house beer or two ($6/pint).  You can bet I'll be back (probably very soon)!"
"Great burger. One of the best fast food burgers I've ever had, right behind 5 guys."
"I've been a fan of Pita Jungle since my ASU days, when I lived down the street from the Apache location. Now I live in the Arcadia area so this is the one we frequent. I haven't noticed a huge difference between the two locations, same great food, same stoned servers.  My usual is the Portabello burger. The balsamic marinade they use is fantastic. The presentation is a little messy, but once it hits your lips it's so good.  I pass on the new potatoes for steamed spinach and it's pretty amazing.  Everyone knows the hummus rocks. I love how they let you split up a small order between the roasted bell pepper and jalapeno cilantro. It's like a little hummus sampler for less than $5.  The service can be spotty, especially when it comes to drink refills, but I've surprisingly never had an order come out incorrectly. I normally would not be surprised by this standard service expectation being consistently fulfilled, but I have had some BAKED servers here, so the fact that they can remember my steamed spinach substitution each and every time is kind of impressive. So, good job, stoned servers. Maybe work on the drink thing, though."
"There is nothing bad in here !! It's true. Amazing bagels, bakery section, I've always loved their sandwiches and there omelets are so good. I remember they used to be in the sun coast hotel and they had some amazing sugar free desserts. I don't know if they make them anymore. Sad . But do go, it's so good ."
"We arrived for our reservation at 7:15pm.  They seated us right on time.  The resturant was fairly loud at first but once the family dinner croed cleared out at 7:30pm it quieted down.  The food and service was outstanding, and at a very reasonable price.  I highly recommend Mimi's very a late dinner."
Very overpriced for what you get. I had the skirt steak which was stringy and tough. I've had much better meals at mad mex. Our server was extremely impersonal and we were rushed out. Will not return.
"If you are looking for entertainment from the wait staff, save your time and money because you will not get it at this location.  Not only did we not have an interactive waitress, we did not see any around us.  We love Dick's Last Resort, however, going to this location was a total let down for our family.  This experience for us was nothing more than a very expensive dinner with no entertainment.  Very disappointing..."
"This restaurant is a GEM!  Service was spectacular and the food was terrific. Based on Yelp review, I ordered the Traditional Greek Salad.  Absolutely fantastic - light dressing, HUGE size and totally delicious.  I strongly suggest going when they have their live entertainment.  Beyond my expectations.  We were treated like valued guests.  Try the spanokopita - it's delicious.   Belly dancing and live music with incredible singers.  What a delight."
"I can see why The Packhouse is not a packed house. (See what I did there?)  I already wasn't really thrilled about coming to this joint. I checked the reviews, they weren't really poppin. I looked at pics, weren't enough of them. And the menu looked... okay.  But I'm always down for something new and different and my homie was eager to check this place out, so why not?  Welp, it wasn't good my friend.   I ordered the Packhouse burger; because, if you can't do a burger right, then something is seriously wrong. And it was ALL wrong. Not once but twice.  My other homie decides to get the same thing. She didn't want the tomato jam (she's allergic to tomatoes) and she wanted hers cooked medium well. I wanted the tomato jam and my meat to be cooked medium. You following so far?   We both asked for the Mac and cheese as a side. Side note: why do they not have fries???!!! Not even sweet potato fries???!! Like forreal tho. Anyway, they bring out my homies burger and my other friends dish. They bring out my food last. There's a TON of mustard on my burger. Literally all I can taste is mustard. They killed my meat. Like if the cow wasn't dead before they cooked it, they made sure they killed it when they grilled it. And after a few bites I noticed I didn't have any tomato jam. Come to find out they switched me and my homies Burgers. Although her meat was well done and dry as well. My homie is breaking out (tomato allergy) and I'm just over the burger.   They were nice enough to comp our burgers and asked if we wanted new ones. We were good with that. They also said they would give us free dessert. OKAAAAY!!!  New Burgers come out, they get the toppings right and the chef wasn't as enthusiastic with the mustard the second go round. HOWEVER! My meat was still dry and over cooked. {sigh}.... whatever. I couldn't finish the burger. Like the meat was a choking hazard.   The Mac and cheese was aight. I love Gouda, but it wasn't hittin it. Ah well.  My other homie said her crab cake was too juicy. I didn't get much else from her meal but she did say this place was 2 star worthy as well.   Also we get the complimentary bread and butter AFTER we get our food. The homie has to ask for the bread and butter. Strange and not needed at that point.   The desserts (forgot to take pics) were actually really good. The hummingbird cake was moist and not too sweet. I don't like nuts but I had several bites anyway cause the flavor was really good.   The oatmeal cream pie cookie joint was pretty good but again I'm not a fan of nuts and thick creamy icing. But anyone who is down for this, would love it!   So there you have it.   The service was top notch. I gave more than 20% of what my bill would have been because I can't fault the staff, but I'm sorry guys, the food needs some work.   The location and setup is dope. The vibe is chill and everyone is really attentive and nice. If they work on the food, I can see this place getting packed with the quickness."
"I like to come here every 3-6 months. I'm not huge on injera, so every quarter to half a year is enough to get my fix.  I have loved this place every single time I went, except the last.   The (beautiful) waitress is really helpful in helping you choose a dish and (again other than my last visit) they are always delicious. Unfortunately the last time I went the dish she recommended tasted like old Chinese food (which is very strange) but I've been probably 10 other times and each time it has been delicious, so I'm going to just assume it was a one-off bad day and give it another try, because honestly the food is generally really good and filling.   Prices are decent, they have Groupons available for this place a lot, so if you are nervous about going, wait for a Groupon to be available and that should cover half the meal for 2-3 people.   The place is usually pretty packed but on a week night you can usually get a seat without having to wait."
"Oddly enough, it was a negative Yelp review that drew me to Diamond's in the first place (a review I see is no longer on Yelp). But after putting up with crappy service just to get the Sourdough burger I love, the argument with a man who was either the GM or the owner about whether a service dog could come in his bar was the last straw.   I'm not sure why he thinks he can refuse service to someone coming in with a service dog, but that was the last straw for me.   I will miss the Sourdough Burger, but trust me when I suggest you find a nicer place and ask them to make a Sourdough burger (on sourdough bread with grilled onions and cheese)."
this hawaiian/korean restaurant brought me back to the local cuisine of  hawaii. I ordered the meat jun combo plate and it was good. the soy dipping sauce for the meat jun should be bottled and sold in markets. deifinitely stopping by to try the other items on the menu. The ALOHA spirit is deifinitely alive and well in las vegas..thanks to RUSSEL.
I love Salad and Go! Healthy delicious food on the fly. The best drive-through in Surprise! Very friendly staff & fast service. Have loved every single thing I've tried off the menu!
I have been eating sushi a LONG TIME. This place was so wonderful. Great sushi! I strongly recommend eating here. Enjoy
Stopped here for lunch after our dam tour based on yelp reviews. We were starving and this place hit the spot. Do yourself a favor and get the cheese sticks!  YUM!  Girlfriends had the bacon burger and said it was top notch. I had the BBQ chicken salad and it was also very good. Service was good too. All in all 6 thumbs up from the 3 of us!
"Great place.  We stayed at the Hermosa Inn, and dinner and breakfast at Lon's were included as part of our package.  We were warmly greeted by the gentleman who was the host upon entering.  Dinner was fantastic - the strip steak was perfectly cooked and flavorful.  Started with the tortilla soup and finished with the panna cotta.  But our favorite part of the meal was the side of truffle fries - wow!  Thought it was great that they had local beer options from McFate Brewing on tap - rare to find them on tap around the valley outside of the brewery.  Our server was very pleasant and helpful, and my wife got a birthday card from the staff since it was her birthday.   We returned for breakfast the next day.  Breakfast menu was considerably smaller and a lot less options, but the food was really good.  I had the ham & cheese omelette, which was great.  Large portion of toast accompanied my omelette, and the crispy potatoes that came with the omelette were really good.    Overall a really great experience - wouldn't hesitate to return for an upscale meal."
"I've been to Sakana twice for lunch and both times have been happy with the sushi and service. Instead of creating longer rolls with more pieces of sushi they create shorter, fatter rolls. Makes for a bigger piece of sushi which I'm ok with.   I'd say the quality of fish, rice and seaweed is good to very good. I had 3 rolls and walked away full and content. It's not the very best sushi I've ever had but it's a great choice here in Scottsdale.   If you're in the area and are looking for a good sushi restaurant I'd recommend you try Sakana out."
"There is absolutely no point in coming here if you come late or do not have a daybed.  You won't have anywhere to put your stuff which is a nuisance.  There is bag check but the lines are long.  Plus, sometimes you don't want to stand the entire time in the pool after standing in the long lines in the sun.  I saw a girl get hooked up to an IV and taken out on a wheelchair.  Stay classy, Vegas.  Also.... the water gets murky after a while.  Do you really want to go in there?  You would be putting yourself at risk for foot fungus or STDs.  If you do decide to go here, you can go in with full-fledged self-confidence because people will flaunt their stretch marks, cellulite, and other goodies."
"This place is gross. It was understaffed. I was given a super dry, day old chicken in my Ceasar salad. The water made me sick. I am hoping a truly do not have food poisoning but definitely feel sick to my stomach after eating here.  I will not eat here again."
Fastening vibe and Vegas Strip friendly. Staff takes care considerably and is very current. Love the scenery! Thank you Azuza staff. xoxo ACE ENCORE
"This is my second visit; my first was back during CES in Jan. with a young friend visiting Vegas for the first time and who had never had a bloody mary...  Service was very good, the LARGE Bloody Mary was impressive, and the Jack Daniel's chocolate cake was to die for.  I liked it enough to want to go again.  Except for the BIG Bloody Mary meal - slim jim, pickles, cheese cubes, peppers,  candied bacon !!!!; sausage; red onion (see pics, only large U6 shrimp were missing. ..) everything else was a disappointment.  Service was very strange - the smiles were abundant, but everything else about the service was off, from how scarce our server was, to her not willing to take an order for breakfast from us,  yet a table seated after us served by someone else got breakfast; to how long it took to place our orders, to how long it took to get our order.  I got the wings - terrible, even though they are a signature dish. Bland, small, bones broken with sharp points and bone chips all throughout...now that I think about it, I don't know why I didn't complain and send it back.   Maybe I was too consumed consuming the bowl sized meal of a Bloody Mary.  I'd go back just for that; I'd stay away for everything else (well, the Jack Daniels chocolate cake makes a compelling point...)  Two stars or even one if not for the Bloody Mary meal or Jack Daniels chocolate cake."
We love Kneader's! Their French toast is literally the best French toast ever. And their breakfast sandwich on a croissant is sooooo yummy. We always have the best service there. Workers are nice and friendly and we get our food quickly. Highly recommend Kneaders! A great place to go to brunch with friends.
"BRFC is a solid place to try some really good chicken. I've been very happy on my recent visits to BRFC. Our chicken combos were tender, juicy, crispy, and flavorful. We like to order their chicken tender combos and dip them in all their different sauces. My husband and I really enjoy it and plan on returning.   Pros:   * Friendly & efficient service when you order at the counter  * Clean and modern decor with plenty of seating/table options and large windows * Large TVs (we watched football during one of our visits)  * Combos include their shoestring fries and small cup of coleslaw    Fries: skinny, crispy, salty, and plentiful | Coleslaw: a bit bland for my taste * Their juicy chicken has a nice crisp crunch with a tasty and flavorful seasoning.    Their chicken is delicious with a slight spicy dry coating (a hint of cajun)    We do not find it to be greasy and the breading was light and not overwhelming  * Their Boylan pop is served at a soda fountain and is sweetened with cane sugar and refillable * Their iced tea is sweetened with honey or unsweetened and refillable * Milkshakes are thick and creamy and my husband always orders one with his chicken * Honey Dipping Sauce options: wildflower, chipotle and wasabi honey flavors    I LOVE all their honey options for my chicken tenders  * Other Dipping Sauce options: habanero hot sauce and their own BRBBQ barbecue dip * Lunch Box Special Deal:  M-F |  11am - 4pm  | 3 whole wings, fries, and a drink = 8 bucks   Cons:   * It seems a bit pricey for what it is. Essentially, it is priced a little higher than what you would expect for a chicken joint. You're looking at $10 - $15 a person for combos. However, I do find it to be a higher quality than most chicken joints. It's an upscale atmosphere for a 'fast casual' restaurant.    Review 1 for 2017"
"Pretty good for a first time. My UberEATS delivery experience was mediocre but the pizza was one of the best I've tried so far.   I ordered the Mediterranean and it had a lot of flavor from all the different veggies and spices. My only complaint is: the crust was a bit dry, a little more olive oil wouldn't have hurt.   I'm very captious about my pizza, but I honestly state I would order another one again in the future."
"I wouldn't consider this Aunthentic Mexican food, like my hubby does, but it sure was tasty.    Portions are nice and price is right.  I thoroughly enjoyed my Chimichanga. The enchiladas, especially the seafood enchilada was flavourful.  I think I was a little suprised to find myself really liking the food.    Its more American Mexican food but it was good!  The service I recieved was 5 stars. Everyone was nice, I noticed there was mostly teenagers working there, and they were very friendly and helpful.  They checked up on us to make sure everything was alright, but they weren't overly obtrusive to where you feel bothered.  They put some restaurants to shame, and this isn't even that type of restaurant.    Definitely will be making this a regular place to go to."
"We have been wanting to try this place since it opened and finally went Saturday evening.  We sat on the patio and had some delicious cocktails.  We eventually went in and sat at a table for dinner.  The chicken and waffle appetizer was delicious.  For entrees we ordered the shrimp and grits and the steak.  Everything was delicious except for that the cook could not get my steak right.  They tried three times to achieve medium rare but just couldn't get it right.  Fortunately, for me our waitress who was fabulous was more upset about it than I was.  She would take it back to the kitchen even before I had the opportunity to complain.  The manager stopped by and was so apologetic and gave us a gift card to come back.  Even though I would probably never order the steak again, we will definitely be back for the ambience, the drinks, the other yummy food, but most of all for the EXCELLENT customer service that is so rare to find these days.  Well done Trey!  Thank you!"
Had brunch here Sunday with a friend. The meal was very good. I mean the options were limited but over all a solid brunch! I've only come to Brewsters on one other occasion so I can't speak to the service before as it was at another location in Calgary. The place wasn't busy. The staff was rather slow but the food was good so no complaints on that.  I had the southwestern omelette and I LOVED the salsa inside it was so yummy and really added a nice touch to the meal. Prices were also fair. I decided to branch out from my usual egg benny. It was a nice change.
"Loved the New York decor. Pretty sure the owner was working the cash register(you could tell he's from NY), there was around 100 things on the menu. For a sandwich joint I think that's a little much, so it took me a few minutes to decide. Food was so-so it would of been a lot better if the ""grade"" of meat was better. The owner also didn't seam to happy, I mean c'mon man! If your gonna have your own business love it! Don't look like your gonna kill the next person who orders a sandwich."
The amazing food and friendly atmosphere keeps us coming back!! My hubby is vegetarian and we love how we can choose anything off the menu for the both of us and it tastes delicious!
I honestly love this location! Blanca is always so welcoming and friendly. Her personality definitely makes it a fun experience! Every time I come in my food is fresh or if I ask for it to be made fresh they will make it. We ordered the orange chicken and Kung pow chicken tonight and it was soooo yummy. I love coming back here because the staff makes me feel like I live in a small town where people know each other and say hi with a smile.
"I'm not sure how I rate this restaurant because I walked in to get some soup. It was around 4pm and I was in destroyed need of something that would clear my sinuses. Hot and sour soap always does the trick. I was told that I couldn't order a cup because it was supper time. That's okay, so I ordered a bowl of soup to take home... it was 11.00, and that okay too. My only thing is that it looked like a cup and the soup was not too fresh. It was good though. I'm not too sure if I would go back because the prices seemed too high and for a bowl of soup being 11.00, it wasn't great and there was much, but broth."
My neighbourhood bar.   I love the staff and often drink with them. Til the wee hours.  Great daily food and drink specials.  Cheap pool and darts.  Good atmosphere for sports games on one of them many televisions.
"We had breakfast there today for about $25 each with tax and fees included but 2 of our party of 4 were covered by the bed and breakfast deal from JW Marriott and they didn't charge for the kid. Food was ok but plentiful and what makes it a 5-star for me is the ambience and the patio with the beautiful koi pond and cascades, refreshing in a summer morning. Staff was attentive amd we were there at 10 and breakfast ends at 11 but didn't fell pressured at all and nobody gave us looks for taking some fruit with us on our way out ;-)"
"Really confused about the high star rating here...  I was actually excited for airport food due to the high Yelp reviews.  Should have dialed down my expectations?  I got the teriyaki chicken with brown rice.  The rice and chicken were both really dry.  The veggies were soggy.    Service was great, unlike some other posters, but that did not make up for the food.  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing?    Price was right - under $10 for food with tax."
"So fresh and delicious! My go to poke spot in the city! Generous portions, clean and great selection of accouterments!"
"The Venetian is an elegant and distinguished resort and casino. Gorgeous and romantic decor and interior. On the way to your room, you are greeted by candlelit hallways and ceilings to light your way. Even though I didn't try the restaurant, Bouchon, the smells emanating from the kitchen made my mouth water. The casino was expansive and had signs everywhere for easy navigation. Rooms are huge, clean, and well-maintained. The convenience store and bakery/coffeeshop is located at the entrance to the casino and near the elevators to the rooms which is a plus if you need to get a quick pick-me-up or forgot to pack something. The Venetian is a must-stay if you are ever in Las Vegas and will give you a dining, gambling, and staying experience that you will never forget."
Very disappointing.  Overpriced mediocre food.  Refried beans served with fajitas were so hot that they not only burned my tongue but throat as well.
This place was worth the taxi ride! The food was great and affordable! The atmosphere was fun and it is nice that it is a little bit off the strip and away from the chaos. The portions were huge and my friend and I ordered several items to split between us. There are great breakfast options and there is a very casual vibe
My wife ate here and I had pizza from another place she had the Vinnys sandwich and it was huge and it was so huge and so much she ate half and couldn't eat no more gave the other half to a older lady later that day we saw her walking down the strip and she said the sandwich was excellent to my wife really liked it it was just too much for one person to eat
"Wow, so delicious.  I don't have any pictures to post because we ate everything too fast!  We used the check-for free coffee and tea to start while we munched on the complementary granola, which was a nice roasted salty and sweet flavor.  Then our savory crepes came out quickly, the breakfast burrito for him and a custom buckwheat for me (white cheddar since they were out of Gouda, with local ham).  Mine came with a side of dressed greens that complemented the crepe well.  I was disappointed I could only order scrambled eggs on the side when I wanted a gooey poached egg because they had already cracked all the eggs, so I skipped the eggs.  As we finished up our main course our sweet crepe came out.  I was surprised how full I was from the one savory crepe, but I made room for my half of a simple bruleed crepe with nuts.  You can really taste the quality of the crepe itself when it's minimally dressed.  We finished with the complementary dessert of chocolate triangles and a rose infused marshmallow roasted right at the table.  Overall I'm very happy with our experience and the friendly service.  We struck up some good conversation with the server and found everyone but the cashier to be friendly.  I will definitely be back soon!"
"Keep in mind, I only eat here once in awhile, cuz the food is very cheap, and taste ok.  The wait staff from about 11am on, are pretty nice. Before that time, get ready to deal with Dawn of The Living Dead. They're like pissed off zombies.. Which sucks cuz this place's best deal, is their ""before 11am, $2.49 breakfast.""  I've had everything from their Eggs Benedict to their salad bar. Their salad bar is very basic. Cheap square croutons, fake Baco Bits, half-wilted(so take your time picking out the good lettuce, and leave the crap to another patron, haha) lettuce, and OK dressings. I get it. They can't have fresh stuff at this price.  Back to the Eggs Benedict. Everything on the Benny was cheap. The English muffin WASN'T TOASTED! Never seen that before. The hash browns were WAY too crispy.. Like eating unflavored Pop Rocks.. The Hollandaise sauce was just ok..  All in all, if you're very hungry and either cheap or on a budget, stop on in.. Then again, Sunset Station is close by, and their $7-8 buffet is way better!"
"I came here on a saturday night for dinner to celebrate my 25th birthday with the best of company, fun entertainment, and delicious food!!! I'd been here before but always sat in the front of the restaurant... had NO clue how HUGE this place was!!! We sat in the very back (where it seems many of the large birthday parties were seated) The ambiance of the restaurant is very dark and jungle esque (if i remember correctly o.o) lol very ruckusy and vegas appropriate! There were drummers and scandalous (but h0t) dancers going up and down the aisles which provided for the fun entertainment.  But enough of that, on to the main event.   We had a party of 6 and decided it best to do as our super nice server suggested, omakase style :)  - Cucumber cocktail on the house!!! They brought each of us a mini cocktail to start the meal off! Very nice and considerate of them! nice and refreshing and definitely got my appetite going :)  - A trio appetizer platter consisting of well salted edamame, roasted shito peppers, and deep fried string beans served in the most delicious chipotle aoli sauce (all 3 were delicious but I think my favorite would have to be the roasted shito peppers with a drizzle of lime juice for a nice kick) - Yellowtail Sashimi MINI TACOS!!! These were sooo fun and delicious! Great fushion idea! The restaurant is VERY accommodating, we mentioned to them 1 of the girls is allergic to cilantro so they brought out a special lobster taco for just for her! The flavors were bold and the taco shell was nice and crispy.  But I think I still enjoy DOS CAMINO'S mini tacos better...those are to.die.for.   - Ahi tuna over a piece of bamboo and basil leaf.  This was an interesting combination.  Probably my least favorite dish of the night.  The basil leaf was a bit overwhelming and covered the taste of the ahi too much.  - Filet Mignon with oversized asparagus.  The meat was tender and very well cooked, very pink in the middle.  I'm not a big beef eater so I only ate the edges of the piece but my friends seemed to enjoy it.  Definitely not one of the top dishes of the night but was still yummy.  The ASPARAGUS however, was QUITE delicious!! they probably cooked it in butter... hahaha i'll take it :) A good bite on the outside and nice and tender on the inside!  - Sea Bass with oversized Peruvian corn!!! YUMMMY!!!! The sea bass was nice and flaky.  Flavoring was a bit salty but I feel like at these restaurants they tend to do that a bit...i mean, everyones a bit intoxicated so salty foods are what people want LOL The peruvian corn was just really fun to eat!! My friends really enjoyed it but I definitely like summer sweet white corn on the cob better :)  - MUSHROOM POT ON CRACK. THIS WAS DEFINITELY THE SHOW STOPPER OF THE NIGHT!!! the flavoring of the sauce, the textures of the 3? 4? different mushrooms. happiness. The sauce was like a cream of mushroom, milky, full flavored, salty, a hint of sweetness... too good. needless to say we all took a bite and just smiled in satisfaction. We all stared at each other and knew rice was needed to soak up all that bomb sauce!!  - 4 different Sushi Rolls were brought out last (3.5 stars).  All 4 were decent, nothing really to rave much about unfortunately. :(  I'm a big big sushi lover and have had some off the chart rolls so I can't pretend these were anything to die for.    ***The first time I came my friend ordered for the table and I definitely think that made a difference.  They have some REALLY scrumptious dishes that I wish I could've ordered for my friends to try!! Perhaps next time!! I'll be more prepared lol   OVERALL RATINGS: Food - 3.75 stars (except for the mushroom pot on crack... 4.5 stars for that) Food (for the first time I came) - 4.25 stars!  Drink - 4 stars for the cucumber cocktail & bottle of Santa Margaritta Pino Grigio Presentation - 4 stars Service & Ambiance - 4 stars  I gave this place 4 stars mainly because I had a great time that night, and the company I kept definitely played a big part in that.  The food IS goood, just a bit $$$$.  Its definitely a GREAT place to go with a group thats just looking for some good eats, good drinks, and a great time :O) BOTTOM LINE: I'd DEFINITELY GO BACK AGAIN!!"
"4 stars means I'm a fan, and yes Id agree with that. However what is putting them from a solid 3 to a 4 is the value and service. Seriously, a chopped or caesar salad for 3.95? 5-7pm Happy Hour that includes half off starters, pizzas, and glasses of wine, wow, for real!   So with that being said we had a great time at Marcella's, yes folks a chain, but a decent chain with only a few locations in Ohio. The straight forward menu makes for easy navigation and the helpful suggestive service was more than enough to make decisions easy.   Okay, we kinda freaked out when  we heard the half off starts and pizzas.. we ordered way to much but was so worth it.   Started with the meaty Sicilian pizza, topped with Capacola, Salami, Meatballs, Asiago Cheese, Red Onion, which was probably my favorite. The crust was thin and crunchy and all of the flavors of the meats and cheese really were balanced so I could taste each with one bite after the next.  Beef Carpaccio was a close runner up with its thinly shaved rare beef, toasted capers and wild arugula. The flavors were bright thanks in part to the lemon aioli.  The Braised Veal Meatball was so light and tender I wanted to order another as my entree rather than the Gnocchi con Bolognese . The problem with the gnocchi was the gnocchi themselves. Kind of like eating raw biscuit dough, but the lamb bolognese was simple and delicious.   The Chicken Parmesan was served how I like to eat with both alfredo & tomato sauce. My only wish is that it had just a bit more sauce so I could use the house ciabatta to sop up the extra.   Desserts are kept simple like the rest of the menu so we shared with Cherry Crustada. The crust was light and flaky, the cherries filling slightly tart and the ice cream rich and creamy, *pant pant* yum!  This was certainly a pleasant experience with a welcoming laid back feel, generous portions and affordable pricing. Oh yes, they also use Opentable.com for free online reservations, so yes, I'm definitely a fan!!!"
"My daughter and her boyfriend were very excited to go here. They paid almost $200 for 2 Buffet of Buffet 24 hour passes . They had crab sushi shrimp and oysters.  Then about 2 hours later she started feeling very Sick . For the next 2 days she could barely move , vomiting , diarrhea cold sweats . Her whole vacation was ruined.  We returned to the Rio seafood buffet talked to manager MIKE .  Filled out the security forms  with the EMT .    Mike tells us that even though she got food poisoning from there seafood . And could not use the 24 hour pass . He could not give a refund. But He offered a free buffet if she wanted to eat there again... Really ???   Good luck eating here!!!! You go to a casino to gamble money ,not your health!"
"One of my coworkers mentioned this little spot he heard about not too far from work. So today for lunch a few of us decided to check it out. My personal favorite places are hole in the wall joints so walking into this restaurant definitely provided that vibe. Miss Dee, the owner I believe, was one of the nicest owners I have met at a restaurant. She immediately came out of the kitchen and personally greeted us with amazing hospitality. She gave us the low down of her spot answering any questions about the food we had. Now onto the meat and potatoes, literally! Three of us got a large loaded potato, each topped with different meats. One had the beef brisket, the other had pulled pork, and I got the buffalo chicken. Don't expect your food to come out in a minute like it was just microwaved. Everything was freshly put together and it was beyond worth it! Each meat was cooked to perfection with amazing flavors throughout the potato. Combine that with melted cheese, sour cream, and other delicious toppings, this potato can't be beat!  Will definitely be a return customer to try out other various customizations on my loaded potato!"
we enjoyed excellent service and very good food. salads were perfect as was soft shell crab and chicken livers. broad pasta was excellent as was scottish beef. very good and extensive wine list. wonderful experience and good value for the price
"I honestly didn't find this place to be all that.  Don't get me wrong its a nice modern place but I can find better made items that Honey Salt offers for way cheaper price.  The only good thing that I was blown away by is their Fried Calamari.  That was a pretty legit dish.  Their biloxi buttermilk fried chicken sandwich I believe i can get somewhere else for cheaper and made better.  We also got their Caesars Salad and that was literally 14 dollars for some salad with a touch of caesars dressing and some cheap ""free range"" chicken breast that was grilled.  Overall not too impressed with what they served.  And this is on a hunch but if bread was given to everyone as an opener then they most def didn't care for us.  Everyone else had bread on their tables but us, don't know if you had to order it or not.    Again, overall the place is well lit and looks great.  Foodwise....id go somewhere else.  As a local i should've known better but wanted to try something new.  Now i know, i won't go back.  There are other places around town to get same food for cheaper price and same quality. Good luck."
I called them at 10.30 saying ill be there in 15 minutes given they close at 11. When I arrived with a party of 15 ( which I mentioned on the phone) they denied me and were extremely rude. Lack of professionalism and courtesy.
"I LOVED this buffet. To me it was comparable to The Buffet at The Wynn. They had prime rib, warm snow crab legs, ceviche, sushi, an omelet bar, and a little of everything. Tons of desserts as well!! Define lay coming back next trip to Vegas.."
"Oh my goodness.... where to start?!! I had the pleasure of enjoying some BBQ chicken, beans and potato salad about a week ago. Not only was the meat perfectly tender and juicy, but the beans, oh my god the beans. Talk about perfection. On top of the delicious food, the service I received was beyond 5 stars. I was offered a sample while working and was told he could bring the food into me at my convenience but I didn't take advantage assuming that I would be able to catch him outside and take a look at my options. Unfortunately for me as I was walking out of the building Steven was pulling away. He saw me though, and as I expressed my sadness in missing my opportunity. He so kindly and without hesitation pulled over and prepared me the dish of my choosing. He was so gracious and even gave me a small story of how he got started. I would recommend Holy Smoke BBQ to ANYONE and EVERYONE! My heart and my belly were so full! Thank you again for your extremely generous service!"
"Good food but service sucks: waitress apparently was in a rush, serving appetizers and burger plates at the same time... didn't ask for desert and brought the bill and the credit card machine all together... almost cleaning the table as we were sitting at the table. No smile, no care.... almost rude."
"So the food is pretty good but overpriced. The thing that irks me is there was basically no alcohol in the Caesars I ordered. I am small, I had two, and I wasn't even tipsy. No taste of alcohol, no feel of it. Super lame. Also, no happy hour."
"What can you say about this place that hasn't already been said. The hype is true, and we're lucky to have nationally renown chef Chris Bianco stay here in Phoenix all these years. Pizzas are perfect, and pastas are surprisingly great & fresh (if you can resist ordering a pizza). Menu is often changing and new additions and recommendations are usually worth taking. Have not yet been to the original downtown location, am intimidated by no reservations and what I expect to be long lines for a reputable place. The ""Town & Country"" location is fashionable shabby chic, not intimidating. Parking is kind of a cluster. Look forward to coming here again on the next possible date night."
"Yet another example of a business cashing in on location at the expense of quality. Cocktails are chain-restaurant worthy, wine list is weak, and seafood is only barely competently prepared.   Calamari was good. Worth it, served with a large pool (at least 2 cups) of seasoned mayo.   Lobster roll was rubbery and tasteless. The bun was exceptional however. The salmon was Kirkland's best, and ""crusted with pecans""=sprinkled.  Hmm. The grouper sandwiches were passable. McCain fries. Yum.   The day was sunny. The company was excellent. I noted the The Pump ouse Grill on Lakeshore. I'll park there next time and enjoy the wings."
"Remember 98 South Wine Bar?... or the 2nd 98 South Wine Bar?... or Fat Cat?  That space in Downtown Chandler has a new tenant, and they seem like a keeper.  DC Steak House is a rarity in Phoenix; a mid-priced, independent steak houses in a sea of chain restaurants and a la carte wallet busters.  Looks:  Well, it does look fairly similar to the previous restaurants, except they changed the bar area and the art.  I like it.  It's elegant and not too dark or too partitioned.  There's a mural on one wall that I think the owner painted.  The place is a nice addition to Downtown, which is still fighting off the urban sprawl of mega-chains.  Crowd:  Seemed happening, although it was Opening Night.  A wide mix of young and old.  Food:  My eye was drawn to the large selection of fish, but I decided to go with steak at a steak house.  The salad was solid.  I especially liked the Italian dressing with a little Feta cheese in it.  Bread was OK.  My steak was great, tender, flavorful, and perfectly cooked.  Served with a (undercooked) baked potato, and sauteed mushrooms.  My friend ordered the walleye.  I was a big fan, but he said it was a little bland compared to what he catches in Minnesota.  Maybe that was a fish story.  Value:  Here's where I thought this place shined.  Meals were in the $18-30 range, including salad and potato.  They have $10 sandwiches, too, but they're not served on Fri/Sat until after 9pm.  Seems fair.  Service:  Service was slow, although it was Opening Night.  They also screwed up my friend's appetizer, serving him the wrong kind of wing sauce.  However, the people could not have been nicer.  The owner apologized and bought us desserts.  (Chocolate Decadence Cake was delicious, although a little rich for my taste.)  Then, the chef came out , shook our hands, and bought us drinks.  I felt like I was in a place where people would remember my name, even though they surely won't.  Miscellaneous:  A lot of decisions haven't been made yet.  Will they serve lunch?  What will they do for happy hour? (a crucial decision in my mind.)  Even the menu will likely vary in the coming months.  Verdict:  I don't go out for steaks often, even reasonably priced ones, but I'll definitely be back to DC Steakhouse to see my new ""friends.""  I've got my eye on the steak sandwich for next time."
"I love Mexican food.  I live across from the Fajita Grill.  I have only been there twice (in 4 years).  As many of the other reviewers have said, the food is sub-par Mexican food.  I appreciated the complementary chips and salsa, and the incredibly unhealthy Boat Dip was pretty decent.  I had the Tofu Mexicana, which was mushy tofu and overcooked vegetables.  As hit or miss as Mad Mex can be, since it opened I have been there more times than Fajita Grill.   It is BYOB, but when I eat Mexican I want an ice cold margarita.  They also charge for sharing plates ($2.50) and ask that you split your check prior to ordering."
"I had the country fried steak and would recommend it.  It's pretty small in the dining area, so I would not recommend a group larger than 4, even so 4 is pushing it.  Knocked off 1 star for cash only."
"This is just a great little find with great N'Orleans-style food. Had the blackened trout. Mr. Bill had crayfish. Shared an appetizer of fried green tomatoes. I normally don't care for collard greens, but they were delicious. You have to try the bread pudding, if you have room. Pleasant staff. Good food. What more can you ask for! Oh, yeah, great variety of libations. Thank you for a new Tega Cay eatery that's good!!"
"This was my first visit to Top Golf, and I brought two family members visiting for the holidays.  The overall concept is quite fun - as an activity alone, we would rate this 5 stars - it is REALLY fun and something you can imagine yourself doing over and over as a social event.  Why two stars, you ask?  There are major issues with this place that test your patience.  First off, when you walk in, its total pandemonium (we came here at 3pm on Friday).  There are two line queue's but no signage or help as to what the lines are for, or where to even stand in line.  As it turns out, the first line is the ""membership line"" - everyone needs a $5 membership.    The second line, is to ""check in"" - by which they scan your new membership card and ask whether you want a bay on a specific floor.    Both of those tasks sound SO easy - and they should be - yet we still waited in line for about 40 minutes to accomplish these two tasks.  The entire time, we and everyone else in line are talking about how inefficient this place is and you would think the managers would see this once, and rearrange things to make it easier.  After all, we really wanted a beer - we could have been through two rounds at the bar in the same amount of  time we spent waiting around to check in.    After all that, we still went to the bar and had two rounds while we waited.  Good selection of beer, bartenders were fast to see that we wanted booze and wasted no time in getting it.    Then, we get our text message - our bay is ready, requiring us to go muscle into the line and tell the check in staff we are ready (which then irritates everyone in line because you are obviously butting in), but thats the way they like it here I guess.    We head to our bay with a ""bay concierge"" that gives us the down low on the mechanics of play.  Its not the most intuitive thing in the world, but it works.    We start hitting balls and our waiter shows up.  He literally walks us through the entire menu, page by page, explaining burgers, and appetizers, and frozen margaritas like we had never been to a pub before and didn't know what a ""slider"" was.  (Mind you, you pay by the hour at this place, so someone taking your time is quite annoying).  We order a bucket of beer and chips and guac, and shoo him off and get back to our golf.  Beers arrive, chips arrive - and our waiter arrives..... and stays.... and gets all chatty about football and where my family is from, and his Grandma in Colorado, and what it was like working after Christmas, and all sorts of topics that none of us care to talk about.  ugh, leave us alone - we are here for golf and beer, not a new pal.  When the chips came out, one in my party leaned over to the server and said, ""do you know one thing thats missing in this place?""  The server leaned in all interested.... ""napkins - there are no napkins on the table"".  Our server launched into a story about why there are no napkins - another server spilled a huge tray of soda into a bussing cart and that knocked over someones golf bag, and on and on and on..... and no napkins.  He stopped talking and stared at us - and we asked him, ""could we have napkins?"" - and there was this 'oh yeah' moment - he was oblivious at times.  So, we shoo waiter off to get another bucket of beer and a refill of chips, and he comes back with the beer, and no chips (and again, all chatty - does this guy have other tables?).  The refill of chips took about 20 minutes.  We came at an odd time, and we were expected home for dinner, but the burgers and sandwiches on other tables looked very good.  The kicker though, was that near the end of our session, our new buddy server out of the blue told us that the day after Christmas, there was a five hour wait, and they ran out of food, and booze, and kegs, etc.  He told us that they were going to get a lot of negative reviews for that on an email service card that is sent to you the next day after playing.  He asked us if we wouldn't mind marking everything 5 stars because they really needed the good marks, and he would buy us desert if we said yes.    OK, this is the business guy in me coming out now, but the whole reason for getting feedback from your customers is to IMPROVE and figure out where you are failing.  The fact that you have a 40 minute check in process, or that you ran out of beer one night, or that there are no napkins on the table, or that there seems to be tons of staff walking around but not helping the bottlenecks - these are ALL issues that management needs to be aware of - but instead, they try to bribe you so that you will rate them the way they want to be rated.  If I owned this place, I would be PISSED off.     Again, its a really fun concept, but it will try on your nerves big time."
"I tried Nichiban for the first time, and I definitely have to agree with the reviews from the other users for this restaurant.  It's a very small place, tucked in a little corner of a small plaza right across Pacific Mall at Steeles/Kennedy, but the food is delicious.  Being a big fan of salmon sashimi, I asked if the sashimi bento and other main courses containing sashimi, can be replaced with all salmon sashimi and yes, it can be done.  I had the salmon sashimi bento box accordingly, and I have nothing but praise for the quality of the sashimi and the taste of the tempura, spicy salmon sushi and even the salad that accompanied the bento.    They even gave us a huge plate of grilled salmon pieces, all on the house - also quite yummy!  The only aspect that they can improve is to add a little dessert at the end, such as green tea ice cream like many other little sushi restaurants tend to do, however I am very content with this place just as it is.  I will definitely be returning to this place whenever I am in the area."
"Although the vibe and terrace are nice and trendy, that's about all this place has to offer.  Came here for drinks and dinner, the cocktails were 10$ and were pretty small and not very strong but they have good variety. The food was average at best and quite overpriced. Not authentic at all but I guess for a bar that is to be expected. Pad Thai was flavourless and honestly Thai express does it better :/ the snacks to share are super pricy for what they are, it was 10$ for 3 tiny satay skewers, and another 10$ for 4 tiny pieces of popcorn chicken on a small bed of rice.  If youre coming here just for drinks I wouldnt say don't go but if youre looking for drinks and asian food I would 100% brasserie Pamika, it is much better in terms of flavour and authenticity and also has a cool trendy vibe"
Best bean and cheese burrito in town!! Our kids beg us to take them there weekly. My sister used taco dilla's catering for a graduation/birthday party for her kids and they did a faboulos job. The set up was top notch and the food was always well stocked . Their customer service was on point . All of the food was amazing stand outs- steak and blue cheese quesadillas! Yum yum
"Been traveling to this restaurant for years.  Can't believe they were out of gaucamole, just lock the door!  Abt 4pm only one other couple eating, very slow svs.  Think they do better evening svs when more servers.  Than close during day!  At least 1 fam member needs to be around, this is what happens when you trust fam bus to someone else!  Food was ok, but I have had better there.  Disappointed but w return."
"Oh my gosh I fell in love with this place today! Lots of vegan options, delicious food - my fav was the falafel and baba ghanoush - and friendly service. Prices are reasonable too. Can't wait to go back for the open face eggplant soon!"
"Snobbish receptionist, good waiters, food is identical to any other Cheese cake factory. And finally they invented a slice of cake that's 1750 calories.  That's art !!!  But their 500 calorie "" diet"" cheesecake is pretty good. Empty at lunchtime !"
"I LOVE Sonic.  I was raised in San Diego, and we didn't have any Sonics, so I was super excited to see them all over town here.  This is the location closest to my house, so it's the one I visit most often.  I have never had bad service here.  All of the order takers and servers are friendly.  The burgers are nothing spectacular, but are good.  I love that you have the option to have tater tots, more fast food places should offer them as well!  The drinks are the best part.  I love that you can customize your soda to add any flavor combination.  There is nothing like a raspberry limeade on a hot day! :)  The desserts are also pretty delicious.  The best time of year is when they have the red velvet cake blast.  I wish they carried it year around.  :(  The pumpkin pie blast is also a really good seasonal treat.  I do wish that they were open 24 hours, but I believe they are open fairly late, until 1am most nights"
"I've stayed at ALL hotels on the strip. Even when Stardust and Frontier was around. I've encountered the atmosphere, the check-in lines, the restaurants, the pools, and the nightclubs of these hotels. HANDS DOWN, Venetian & Palazzo has the best to offer in luxury. Yes, there are clubs better than TAO, and better restaurants than the Grand Lux, but those hotels with don't have great service or great decor or rooms as the Venetian. It's like some hotels focus on one great trait (day club, night club, room accommodations), but the Venetian has it all across the board. Tables are loose, Rooms are suite, family side of pool and adult side. Cosmo is catching up though...but yeah The Venetian is definitely tight butthole"
"FIrst let me explain the 2 stars - we decided to try out the sushi after friends said it was good. We got to Smokin Fins at 6:30 pm thinking we had plenty of time before the Happy Hour menu was over at 7:00 pm. But the wait list was 40 minutes long and we did not get seated until 7:10 pm. Since Happy Hour was over we did not get Happy Hour pricing even though we were waiting on the list for 40 minutes. Left a bad feeling about the service and management. I heard a few other couples expressing their opinions about the same thing but management just said ""Sorry""  Now for the good part. The restaurant had a nice atmosphere and was relaxing inside and outside. The food presentation was impressive.  Service was just OK. The sushi was cut very think and cooked just perfect. If our dinners were not so good we would not return. Since the food was so good, we will give Smokin Fins another chance on our next sushi craving."
"Egg-celent! Was so delicious and would definitely recommend it. I gave only 4 stars because I wish they had more options on their menu. I didn't want bread and opted for the salad at no additional cost. Although the salad was good, I'm not too sure about arugula with scrambled eggs and a slice of cheddar cheese."
"Is it good? Couldn't really tell over the heat. I knew this going in, I like spicy and often think places under estimate how spicy they think their food is. Not here. I had enchiladas, they were spicy. Service was great, atmosphere in the restaurant is colorful. It is a great experience but probably won't make it onto the regular rotation."
"Good spot to satisfy a late night Korean craving! Hot bubbling gam ja tang hits the spot on a cold night. Seating was comfortable, service was a little lacking but courteous. Could do with more sides! All in all a good place if you're looking for straightforward comfort food."
Still the best dinner buffet on the strip. Start with the king crab and shrimp cocktails. Then move on the specialty meats.  Everything sings quality...especially the hand made desserts.
I wanted to David Carradine with the lobster spaghetti.
"We came here on Super Bowl Sunday because we were visiting a friend who lived not far from this place.  When deciding on a place to watch the game, a couple of friends suggested this casino because they had a big sports booking place, and also because it wouldn't be as packed and crazy as the casinos on the strip.  This casino is about a 15-20 minute drive from the strip.  We were immediately greeted with the large screens in preparation for the Super Bowl.  They even had the volume turned up so that people in the area could listen.  They also had some TV's over the blackjack tables which was where we spent the second half watching the game.   There's also an aquarium and aquarium-themed restaurant in which they have a [fake] mermaid swimming in the aquarium and then people can take pictures with her afterwards.  There were TV's in the restaurant showing the Super Bowl as well.  And If you sign up for a players card, you get a free buffet (which we didn't take advantage of, though).   OK place overall.  But the sports book area was definitely a cool place to watch the game.  Watch the game while playing penny slots and get free drinks!"
This place looks hopeful on the outside but is actually pretty bad. My maple glazed salmon was very burnt and lacked flavor. The asparagus it came with was pretty disgusting and soggy. The waitress was great and the side Caesar salad I had was good. The experience was horrible simply due to the blasting crappy music as well. Probably don't eat here.
"This little gem opened up a few month ago and it is run by the same people that have owned the Amena Cafe on Sahara near O'Bannon St. We started with the hummus ""tapas"" (their tapas are not the Spanish variety of small servings of various culinary concoctions but dippings for pita bread which can be ordered as whole wheat or regular). The pita was nice and warm and the hummus rich and flavorful. The Open Face Eggplant was huge mound of food with many different tastes and could have used a touch more tahini (on the side would have been better) but was freshly made and very good. There was more than enough for two meals. I had never had Shawarma before so I order the chicken and beef in the Combo Special. The chicken was spicy and the ""Halal"" beef was tender and spiced perfectly. The only thing one might want to know is that if you are not into spicy foods tell the staff and the chef will back off on the spices. This is important if you have children or people who don't normally eat spicy foods.  If this is not a concern then have at their offers freely.  The dessert was magnificent...an order of Bakalava was heavenly and the Kunaffe with goat cheese was out-of-this world!!  We had more than enough to take home for another meal.  The decor needs work to give this place a more intimate atmosphere as it was a pizza joint for many years but don't let that stop you from going in. The chairs are not the standard plastic or wood bottoms and it wouldn't take much to get this place a little more elegant. In the meantime go and see Amer and get a taste sensation fix...tell him Nick sent you!"
OMG SO good!! I can't wait to go back!! Love the atmosphere and the food was amazing (I had the eggplant)....This was one of my favorite culinary experience of my life! We didn't leave anything in our plate!!! Thank you guys!!!
Everything was pretty good but the beef in the Mongolian beef was very chewy and had a weird texture. I know this is always a 50/50 chance when trying a new Chinese restaurant. The rest of the food was very good! Their noodles are really good and the fried rice.
"Adult grilled cheese?  Novel concept.  The food was good (not great).  The wait was long - prepare for a long wait, this place is always packed!  The bread is quite greasy, but the innards were excellent, along with gigantic portions."
"Okay, so, we had a full meal here, with drinks, for less than $20. Can somebody say Value?!  We came here for brunch on a Saturday around 10:00 AM, and it was relatively full. We ordered: the Malaysian Curry Chicken with Rice ($6.50), the Malaysian Street Style Sandwich ($5.99), soy milk tea ($1.80) and the hot honey lemon juice ($1.80). The Malaysian Curry was delicious but really, really oily (you could literally see the pools of oil gathering on top of the bowl). If you're fine with that (which I was), you'll probably still enjoy it. The sandwich was our highlight - it really filling but still super light and tasty (the bread was white toast, crispy and buttered). It was stuffed with everything it promised, but it didn't make you feel gross afterwards. With the tea, it was a great, comforting Saturday morning meal!  Located right beside the Erindale GO Station in the same plaza as Sushi Tei, Chili Chicken House, and Wonton Chai Noodle (among others), on the northwest corner of Creditview and Burnhamthorpe, and a few minutes away from the Mavis exit of Highway 403, this place really gives you bang for your buck. Plus, the food is delicious, prepared fresh. Overall, a really enjoyable meal.   Our total with tax was around $18.00. With tip, we paid around $21.00. A great, go-to cheap eat in Mississauga where the food is actually decent! Will be back."
"I really don't know how to rate this place. I came for brunch on a Sunday at 12:30 with a reservation. Side note: AWESOME that this place takes brunch reservations. More places should start doing that. But back to my review...so I came at 12:30 with my boyfriend and we promptly ordered a caesar, a bellini, an order of donuts, the duck scramble, and the two egg breakfast. Yes, we're fatsos at heart.   The drinks came in a timely manner, as did the donuts. Then we waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. AND WAITED. We are by no means slow eaters and we didn't stick around for very long after finishing our food, but we didn't leave this restaurant until close to 3pm! It was quite absurd how long our main dishes took to arrive. Definitely unimpressed with the service.   As for the food itself, I'd call it 'decent'. The donuts were delicious, but the chocolate mousse-like dip it came with was rather tasteless. Actually, I actively didn't like the chocolate dip and I LOVE chocolate. My duck scramble was good but nothing special. I loved the potatoes, but everything else just...normal.   Honestly, the best part about this place, in my opinion, is that it takes brunch reservations. I like the decor inside and it's apparently a very popular drink spot, but I probably won't be back for brunch unless all I want is an order of potatoes and a bellini."
Best Chinese food in LKN area. Never disappointed with the take out we get.  They speak English well too!
"We order from this Pizza Hut often and always order a very similar order a stuff crust pizza with chicken, Bacon, and onion on half. We ordered today and the pizza had onion on the whole thing. The manager was rude and didn't want to replace the pizza. After telling him I will come in and talk to the store manager did he change his attitude toward the situation."
"Excellent chaat, okish biriyani, great service. Fresh food. The place is very clean and lively. Unlike the other Indian restaurant s we visited which were so dead!"
Flies on the pizza that was sitting out there.  Ew.  Very disgusting.  I would NOT recommend it ... very unsanitary!
"I love it! Almost all options are available in a vegan version. Yum! I am moving, and am so sad I will not longer be able to come here. So I made one last trip today. I hope they consider expanding so I can enjoy the yummy items here once again."
Got a pepperoni and sausage half sheet pizza from here last weekend and it was delicious. The pepperoni was awesome! The sausage pieces are huge like small meatballs. The sauce is thick and sweet which I like. Tons of cheese on this pizza which caused me to have an upset stomach aftward. Not their fault. I didn't go into the building to pick up the pizza so I can't say what it's like to eat in.
"There's a lot to like about Crepe Bar.  It feels ""cool"" inside, with an independent vibe that's a valuable commodity in suburban Phoenix.  It's bustling and noisy inside, which I enjoy but may be a negative to some.  The crepes are reasonably priced, and they come with a salad and an unexpected appetizer portion of granola.  The crepes were good but not excellent, and the portions were a little smaller than expected.  Unfortunately, during peak times, you can expect a difficult time finding a seat, and a long wait for your food.  Also, the options for non-pork eaters such as myself were limited.  This place is ideal for killing time sipping coffee on a weekend, but not for much else."
"Being a big Laguna Hills OHOP fan, I was disappointed when I visited the Scottsdale AZ location. It felt like a completely different restaurant.  First off--cash only. Wasn't ready for that. Luckily, they have an ATM onsite.  Secondly, they really nerfed the size of the Dutch Baby here. I worked up my friends at how awesome and overwhelmingly large the Dutch Baby is (and that you could share it with two people), but it was a disappointment. It was bit dry, almost burnt and stale tasting.  Third, I felt very rushed. I know that there is a long line, but they were really pushy about cleaning up our plates immediately after we finished and it made for an uncomfortable eating experience.  All in all, there is little to distinguish this place from an IHOP."
Greasy unappetizing fried food. Low quality ingredients. Pretty much tastes all the same.  Never again.
"Second time I have been here,  and the only reason I took a star away,  was because I had to toss my entire takeout dish except the cookie!! I very specifically made sure to say NO BEANS.... Unfortunately,  my food was covered in them!  The service here is very very good... They know their menu and will walk you through finding the order right for you.   The food is very good,  was looking forward to it...  Looks like totinos is lunch today!!"
"I've heard great things about Toast for breakfast and lunch so thought we might get it a try for dinner...  We walked in around 6:30pm on a Friday night,  the restaurant was about half filled. There were plenty of seats in the the front of the restaurant but our party of four was seated in the very back beside the bathrooms and back door.  We sat there for a few minutes (not wanting to be difficult or affecting the order in which the servers were sat)  but  we really couldn't take the cold draft from the back patio door and constant bathroom visits.  We politely ask if we could move to the front.  The hostess obliged but didn't seem too happy about it.  The same server continued to wait on us once we sat in the front (we were glad because we did not want to make him lose a table) .   We were brought a loaf of soft bread to table, pretty tasty but the butter is a little different.  It is a sweet butter with orange zest.   We were told they were out of the ricotta ravioli (the dish I happened to be eyeing) but was told they can substitute the mushroom ravioli.  I ordered the mushroom ravioli,  my husband the lasagna, our friends ordered the chicken pot pie (all white meat), and chicken Marsala with ravioli side.   The server came back out and told us there was only enough ravioli for one of us...... so my friend changed his order to the green beans and mashed potato side. When our  meals came out they served him ravioli, he was told by the server they found some ravioli in the back- um okay, would have been nice to know before he got his meal as he was already looking forward to eating the dish he thought he ordered.  He was served a 2 mushroom ravioli and 1 ricotta (which he said was much better than the mushroom).  I was told by my friends that the chicken Marsala and chicken pot pie were good. My husband's lasagna was good but very rich!! I could only eat a couple bits, he couldn't finish it.  My mushroom ravioli was bland and tasteless. The cream sauce was very watery. I did not enjoy my main dish at all.   On the bright side though, we all got salads and really enjoyed them. I had the small blue wedge salad. It was a large portion with fresh cooked crispy bacon on top. Really good!   Our server disappeared  while we were eating our meal.  The lady who had been refilling our waters took over our table and closed our checks.  As we were leaving, we see our server  sitting behind the bar, playing on his phone and chatting with other guests.... We probably will not be returning to Toast for dinner. It just seemed way to pretentious and we were not impressed by the food or the 93.5 sanitation grade."
"The Turnhouse Grille has what a lot of restaurants in Charlotte are missing... personality and memorable food! Turnhouse is locally owned and staffed with people who genuinely want to be there to make your experience memorable. John and Katie regularly tend bar and and will amaze you with their creativity, homemade bitters, and signature drinks and Sam is there to greet you with her smile and knowledge of the menu. The food and is simply spectacular and the kitchen staff is spot-on with their creations and presentation. My favorites eats are the Shrimp Burger, The Hef Wings, Salmon BLT, and the Pork Chop. I'd wake up from a coma to eat that Shrimp Burger!!! Simply delicious and friendly place to hang out with friends."
"Extremely friendly staff. Smaller seating area than most Nekter Juice Bars, but that has been no problem. Always get my custom order correct. No issues. LOVE location! Conveniently close to physical therapy clinic where I run on antigravity treadmill & blocks from my OBGYN's office. Ample parking."
Used EAT24 take out. Great pizza. Wings are good.  We'll worth it. I will be using them over the hut in the future
"Yoli's is a a great place to have breakfast.  The staff is wonderful and you ALWAYS receive great customer service.  The prices are great, the food is wonderful and the portion size leaves you quite full.  I usually can't finish my meal and end up with a nice snack for later."
"If you looking for the good customer service stay away from this restaurant, the lady work from here never say hi to the customer i went this restaurant yesterday i was so surprised her rude attitude to customer i asked her to about seat and she said ""just go seat any where!"" I still dont know why she answer me with harsh tone voice"
"Im giving this place four stars more for sentiment than taste, but their food is decent. The falafel and gyro sandwiches are both on the small side but tasty and made in a flash. They have basic middle eastern groceries as well as a few hot dishes and classic desserts such as baklava and cashew fingers. A great place to get feta, dolmas , tabouli, or hummus. The baba ganouj is excellent."
"This is my favorite place to go for sushi, because of the ambiance, service, and overall quality of the menu items.   The ambiance is welcoming (literally, with the chefs and servers acknowledging every patron's entrance with a warm greeting, as per Japanese tradition), and it never gets too busy or over-crowded, so there's no reason to awkwardly wait around ever. It's a good place for a first date, not only because sushi's romantic like that, but because it's never too startlingly quiet or loud. There's just enough going on in this restaurant to keep everyone interested without being obnoxiously distracting.  Since the space isn't very large, there's usually only one server on duty, but they always somehow manage to be attentive to all tables. One thing out of the ordinary is that I've always had to ask for the bill, or pay directly at the cashier. If not, I could be waiting for hours before my server would offer to bring it over.  The fish is always fresh and inventive. My favorite is the sashimi salad. It's my all time favorite, the vinaigrette is a perfect tartness in contrast with thin strips of salmon, tuna, octopus, and mackerel. I could eat it forever. Other menu items are always cute and beautifully presented. There are even local nods to the Flames, with the 'Red Mile Roll,' and 'Red Hot Flames Rolls.'   I give Sushi Dining Chopsticks a 5-star rating for being an overall awesome dinner destination."
"So....they changed their prices. One star because the girl at the counter was sweet. I used to get the grilled chicken pasta for 9.00 and now it's 15.00! I can't afford to go back. I think loyalty supercedes trying to make an extra buck. Be loyal to your customers and they will return. I would have been sympathetic to a dollar more, but that's too high a jump. The pasta is good, but not Olive Garden in California  great. I'll never understand why food tastes better in Cali."
"There are some mixed reviews here about Fresh and from a food creativity standpoint I can appreciate that on some of the menu items. However, you're getting what you came for and that's what matters to me.   A mainstay for meal options when I'm traveling, Fresh has fresh bowls, juices and more. Yes it might just be rice and steamed greens but their sauces enhance everything.  When I come for healthy vegan food, that's all I really want. I don't care for the vegetables to be made into unrecognizable too small, creative portions. With that being said, Fresh still has some interesting spins on their menus, most notably the quinoa onion rings which are out of this world! And their homemade hot sauce is equally as good (I finish half the jar with every meal). I just wish there was somewhere like this in Calgary."
"Only my second maybe third time in life in Outback. I came late because that's how I roll. I really don't enjoy a crowd.  Headed straight for the bar which was pleasantly open. Kayla was my bartender, made me a flavored ice tea because I didn't want water or regular unsweetened ice tea. Cheers to that and then she made the the huckleberry moonshine cocktail, only 140 calories. My meal was a 11oz center cut steak, sweet potato and brocoli and cheese. All the food was deliciously seasoned. I'll be back"
Decent dim sum but it's expensive.  A pot of tea costs money and they automatically add the gratuity to the bill.  Take the walk up to Dundas and Spadina for better prices.
"Love this place! It's simple. It's priced fair and the waffle was very good. Sunday was my day to say I have had enough of the twigs and berries and I want pancakes! Well at least a waffle although they have big banner that states now serving pancakes but really who goes to a Waffle Cafe for pancakes...the name tells you what their specialty is.   Anyway I had a waffle with blueberries, strawberries and bananas. No I passed on the chocolate chips, whipped cream and powdered sugar. Hey I was breaking lose on my food choices but didn't want to go crazy...maybe that why I was carving ribs later that night because I knew I had saved some food karma points :)  Also the staff in this place was very friendly, helpful and fun. It was good to hear youthful energy enjoying their work instead of the normal this is just my job type of employee's. This staff gave good service and enjoyed what they do.    I would definitely come back here good food, good service and fair prices. Oh and I forgot to mention they also have cool smoothies I got the Lychee...yum I love the fruit!"
"Good food all around. The meal begins with complimentary sides as most Korean restaurants are known for. In addition to the usual sprouts, kimchi, etc. Island Style also gives you boiled peanuts which were a nice touch. I went wth cold noodles half and half for my meal. I really liked the dish, with each side offering a nice taste. I wish it could have been spicier but in the end I was contently full and very happy with my choice. $14 for the dining experience was well worth it. The restaurant itself had a very mom and pop feel and seemed authentic in every aspect. A very good option for eating in the area."
"I swear if the serving size was more this place could be a easy 4 1/2 Stars. My husband and I along with our boys were in SC last weekend for scheduled maintenance on one of our SUV's and since the appointment was so early we rushed out without breakfast so of course the entire time in the waiting area we were searching for food.  This place was bookmarked by me so we went to check it out after seeing the menu had Vegan options and our boys and I are Vegan.  We arrived and Boy was this place busy, people standing outside waiting for tables and all. I went in to see how the list worked and there was a sheet of paper on the landing with no one manning it and several sets of people in the extremely small (6ppl capacity) entry way. I flagged down a server who then came to take my name and others waiting name down and explained to us all at once how the long table in the middle worked. Basically the table is 1st come 1st served and adding your name to the list put you on wait for the tables around the room on the outer perimeter. We were told 30min so we sat in the car and my husband went inside every 10mins to see if we were coming up since they don't take numbers nor do they have buzzers. I totally don't mind this process at all it seems more down to earth and not commercial.  After about 40 plus minutes we got a table and were so hungry and I ordered the chef special vegan dish which was the only Vegan dish on the list. I was immediately told that the chef special was SOLD OUT and that happened about a half hour before I ordered (meaning if we had a seat I wouldn't got to have it ). Mind you it was only like 11:30am *insert Kanye shrug*   I read on the specials menu that there was a skillet with lots of yummy veggies that I enjoy and some type of meat, I asked if the skillet could be made for me minus the meat. The waitress agreed so that's what I ordered. My husband ordered a veggie egg while omelet dish with a sweet potato waffle. Our toddler had pancakes and fruit.   Look I'm honest so here is the run down on what you we had:  Skillet (cauliflower, squash, sweet potato & red peppers) - This  we super tasty but extremely small. Egg white omelet with veggies(Goid) Sweet potato waffle - Hubby wasn't impressed he stated it was to soft and the texture wasn't what he expected.  We look forward to checking out other items and won't come hungry"
"Awesome breakfast!!! Had the Rubin Benedict and wow was it good! Loved it!! Kid friendly & mom approved,  in fact she had the Florentine Benedict... Good service and prices."
"Absolutely amazing. Think Chipotle for enchiladas. Nice patio, plenty of room inside. The food is really amazing. The prices are great. If you're not in the area it's actually worth the trip.   I ordered 2 chicken enchiladas. I'll be back to try the tacos!"
"""I would give the location 5 stars and the restaurant 3, so we're at 4 stars overall. I went with hubski and a couple of friends for a nice weekend picnic. The experience would have been a 5-star one if we had brown-bagged it, but as it was, we purchased food from the quaint little house-converted-to-restaurant. Hubski and I shared a veggie sandwich and a peach pie thing. Tasty, but most definitely overpriced. The iced tea was tasty and refreshing, but still, sharing a meal with a drink each, it should have been less money. I'll go back for the ambiance. It's definitely kid and dog friendly, but we'll bring a big blanket, some kid toys, a dog or three, and lunch in a brown bag... we'll still buy pastries though."""
"My husband and I drove by Rani's a couple weeks ago and he said, ""International Market? That looks interesting.""  So I made a note to check it out on Yelp later.  After reading the reviews I channeled Liz Lemon and exclaimed, ""$6 vegetarian Indian food? I want to go to there!""  So that is how we wound up at Rani's.  I immediately went to the counter and ordered a thali and paneer paratha (I'm a sucker for paneer), and the cute lil lady behind the counter proceeded to give me an Indian sweet to have while I waited.  She brought out our thali, which consisted of 2 roti, rice, dal, pickles, okra, an aloo-gobi-type yumminess, and I believe kofta (veggie dumplings).  The cute lil lady was feeling generous and also gave us a tomato soup with paneer in it.  Definite bonus points.  Everything was fantastic, although I was expecting a little more paneer flavor to my paratha.  This place is very casual, which I really like about it.  Don't come in expecting the same food that you would get at a sit-down Indian restaurant; instead, expect the kind of food you would get if you were invited to a grandma's kitchen.  After we filled our bellies, we wandered through the aisles of the immaculately clean grocery store.  I hadn't planned on buying anything, but when I found garam masala for super cheap, and black salt that I had been looking for everywhere and couldn't find, and a giant bag of arrowroot powder for a couple bucks (normally $6-$12 for a tiny jar anywhere else)....well you get the picture.  Anything you would need for a well-stocked Indian pantry is here, and then some.    There's also mint and tamarind sauces, bottled lassis, naan, and huge blocks of paneer.  Trust me when I say I seriously considered buying all the above to snack on at home.  I considered giving this place 4 stars, because we went back a couple days later and the food was cold and missing that extra special love like we had the first time.  But it was a Friday evening and there was an Indian soap opera on the TV I think we interrupted....So, obviously, I can't blame them."
"I remember coming to the Buffet at the Bellagio several years ago for Sunday Champagne Brunch and being blown away.   It was one of the best brunches I had ever eaten.  Alas, my most recent trip did not make nearly as stellar an impression.  I brought my mother here for her birthday dinner last month, wanting to share with her the wondrous buffet I remembered.    Well, we got off to a bad start.  My son fell asleep in the car on the way over (he's five and had been in the pool all day) and I carried him into the restaurant.  At the register, I discovered that there was no children's price and that I would be paying more than $30 to enter with my sleeping child.  Because it was mom's birthday, I went with it, but I was annoyed.  No child is going to eat $30 worth of buffet food. They want the pizza and dessert and not much else.  Of course he didn't want to wake up at all and refused to eat much of anything, so I paid for him to sit there and be cranky.  My bad.  As for the adult meals, the food was fine.  I had prime rib, which was only OK, but the mashed potatoes were awesome.  My mother had the crab legs which she loved.  We must have sampled every dessert they served and each one was better than the last.  The waitress was kind of lazy and had to be waved down to refill our water.    Really the food was pretty good, so maybe it is just my son's behavior that's coloring my opinion on our meal,  but I just can't help but feel like we over paid.  There was nothing remarkable offered.  The service was iffy, the food was unexceptional.  Well, dessert was pretty great, but I don't need to pay almost $100 for my family to eat dessert.  I'm just not feeling the love for this place this time."
We got the chicken club and the prime rib dip!!! French fries and side salad!! It was yummy!!!!!!:) Only problem was not a kids menu. They will make a few items for the kids!!! The chicken tenders... The kids did not like them... Not your normal kid friendly kid coating!!!
My kids had an absolutely blast playing here! Lots of fun! My only suggestion would be more comfortable seating for the parents. The more comfortable the parents are the longer the kids can stay & play.
Very nice little casual eatery.  Intimate setting but very flavorful dishes.  I tried the chicken shwarma and it was delicious.   Great prices and the service was reasonably quick as well.
"Everytime I'm in town I hit this place for curds, beer and brats. I spent a whole Sunday watching football here and had a blast. Crowded times are a little annoying, but it is a college place. Love the mustard selections too. Curds are a must!"
"I'm never disappointed picking up a slice at Desert Ridge slices - the kids love  it, and I'm a fan of the NYC triangle slice too. Plus, I pick up all my weekly magazine reads in their shop as well."
Love Nicole. ..she's a fabulous bartender.  Always gives us great service.  Love the wahoo salad with fish.
I most definitely would recommend this place to anyone. Thanx to cake world my cake for my son's baby shower made the entire event that much better! I will be going back in the future!
"I have noticed when 2 guests come and sit on a 4-seating table, the owner always makes it a point to move them saying that maybe there will be a lot of people who in and it will be a hassle to move them later so they shift to the smaller tables. i consider it pretty rude to do that when almost all the tables are empty and in the 2 days I visited, the restaurant was never completely full."
"This place is over the top! The food is great and the portions...when the hell did every restaurant in Vegas begin serving only sumo wrestlers. My family had a great mix of food - the Mayor of Flavortown Burger, Motley Que Sandwich and Vegas Fries. Don't kid yourself, the fries aren't a side; not by a long shot. They are a meal and for $13, they're a very filling meal. We all loved our food, but I'll have to say the Motley Que was the best meal of the night. Damn it! My wife is always bragging about how she's better at ordering, and she did it again here.   This place isn't inexpensive, but the portions and quality make it well worth it. We had dinner at BurGR the night before and for the same $100, this is the better option by a long shot.   My only complaint is the hostess staff. They treat you like crap - you're just a number to them. They have no personality and make no effort to get you excited about the meal - give me you cell number and we'll text you. NEXT! When I asked about the wait after 45 minutes, she told me that she texted me 6 minutes earlier. I showed her my phone - no text. Well, that also meant no apology from her either. She gave me a look like, do you still want in or not, I have other people to be rude to."
Food is good but service is always lacking.  35 minutes wait time for lunch is unacceptable especially when you only have an hour for lunch.
"I love the food at Panera. Only thing about this place is the slow service. Staff behind the counter chit-chats with guests and doesn't seem to notice all the people waiting in line. I seem to always wait in line during my hour break and I'm always rushing to eat to make it back to the office. I also ordered a salad with no cheese but for some reason, they always add cheese and I always have to return the food to get the order corrected and wait even longer."
"I like neon. Theres just something about it that says taboo allure to indulge in all sort of human vices. Moths to the Noble Gas flame, people seem to slither their way to these oasis's of the night, incubating amongst each other in a haze of sensory saturation.   Kelly's beckons to the person who wants to sit and have a beer, the person who may want to catch someone's eye without filtering through waves of affliction shirts over the rancor of the latest Young ___zy song, perhaps someone who wants to wear argyle and sport a mustache and still think its not ironic that he(she?) is trying to be ironic, the person who simply wants to enjoy a solid bev for a price point for ""chincy"" Pittsburghers.   Me? well, I like a stiff drink and 70's decor. Somewhere in a previous life I wore nothing but polyester. More like Miami Vice, or maybe Boogie Nights. Either way, environment is always friendly, or intimate, depending on what you wish.   You cant go wrong with a French 57, the mac and cheese is all sorts of nom nom, and the tab for a night at Kellys is something you can feel comfortable taking home, even if you aren't taking anything else."
"Some notes: restaurant is located in the Esplandade with the AMC cinema and to the east of the Ritz Carleton.  Best bet is to park in the parking garage and then go to the walking mall.  Even so, it's tough to find.  Don't give up.  Also, it is no longer Fuego Tacos, but now Fuego del Mar, with a seafood-centric menu.    That being said.  I was pretty edgy by the time we arrived.  We're from Cave Creek and had been out shopping and then had a heck of a time finding the place, so we arrived about 8.15---pretty close to closing.  And I had a Groupon---and there are Yelp reviews that said the staff DOESN'T like Groupon-ers.  Greeted by guy that I assume is the gent someone described as ""XL"".  He's just a little round.  And was a warm, welcoming fella.  He beamed a smile at us, waved at dining room and told us to sit wherever we wanted.  We chose a cozy booth in the corner.  Our server was there in moments with menus and take our drink orders.  I wish I remembered her name---dark hair in a pony-tail, glasses, and really personable and nice despite it being the end of the night and we were late-comers.    Nice ambiance---exposed brick walls, soft light, great music---DH would have liked their playlist!  TROUBLE: she hands us the menu.  Except for one dish, everything is seafood.  Fuego Tacos is now Fuego del Mar.  DH doesn't like fish and is semi-allergic to shellfish.  I asked if he wanted to leave, and he said no, we had gone thru too much to find the place---he would just order the one non-seafood dish.  At least he didn't have to make a lot of choices!  So DH ordered the Pernil Asada, which was described as slow-cooked pork topped with mango-chile salsa.  His sides were the Green Chile-Bacon Hushpuppies and the Latin Succotash.  I ordered their signature dish of Seafood Chile Rellenos---a poblano pepper stuffed with shrimp, crab and tilapia in a lobster-tomato sauce with hush puppies and Pineapple-Serrano Cole Slaw.  For drinks, DH got the house red and I got a Pomegranate Adult Lemonade.  Drinks arrived in less than 5 minutes.  DH very happy with something he thought would be bottom row plonk.  My Adult Lemonade was SO delicious---I had to be careful!  I could have drank several of them.  It tasted like lemonade with a hint of fruit---but it definitely had alcohol in it!  Entrees arrived within 15 minutes of the drinks.  DH's was all on one plate.  Three hush puppies, Latin Succotash---which looked delish---and a mound of pork with the salsa.  Not super pretty.  My presentation was much more beautiful---a mammoth poblano pepper in a puddle of light red sauce.  Slaw and hush puppies on the side.  Lovely presentation.  My only comment is that serving something in a bowl (albeit large) that needs to be cut is problematic.  I'd like to say how wonderful DH's meal was, but basically I got one bite of his pork---that's all he would share---before he devoured it.  He said it was one of the best pork dishes he had ever enjoyed.  He felt like he was in the Caribbean!  I got no bites of the Succotash, darn him---looked so good!  He scarfed it all!   His hush puppies went that fast too!  Was my seafood Chile Relleno the best thing EVER?  No, but it was VERY, VERY GOOD!  Beautifully cooked, not greasy,  seafood not overcooked at all, the lobster-tomato sauce was delicious.  Again, only quibble I have is serving it in a bowl.  It was a very deep bowl too---a smaller girl might have had trouble reaching in there, but I am fairly tall and long-armed.  The hush puppies---shut my mouth, darlin', but they were dang good!  Lots of lovely, bacon-y flavor, a hint of heat, and a touch sweet.  What is it with those Yankees not adding a bit of sweet to their cornbread?  Whoever made these knew what they were doing.  The Pineapple-Serrano Cole Slaw was in a citrus-y, non-creamy dressing and the crispness, the fruitiness and the heat was a perfect counterpoint to the richness of the Relleno.  Huge portion---I ended up bringing home half the Relleno, Slaw and two hush puppies---LUNCH!  YUM!  DH swined his plate so it's deli turkey for him, hahaha!  Bonus---ended up talking to the gentleman in the booth next to us---so interesting.  He is a musician who's lived all over the US and the world---Europe and the Middle East.  Really neat guy.  I wouldn't live in the City, but I love visiting the City 'cause you meet the most interesting people!  So at the end, I pulled out my Groupon and gave it to our server, apologizing that I had ""hid"" it until the end, but that Yelp reviews had indicated Groupon-ers got short shift as far as service went.  She took it graciously with a smile and said one of the issues was when they were Fuego Tacos, people ordered $9 plates than proferred a $10 Groupon.  Not nice.  (BTW, Fuego del Mar entrees from $20-$25) For sure, we will be back.  It's a field trip for us, but worth it.  Just an all-around good experience."
This was my first time going to Harvey's. I was so impressed! The service was wonderful. The cook even came out to check to make sure we were enjoying our meal. The burgers were the best burgers I have had since moving to Phoenix. The restaurant it's self is no thrills but I would recommend it to anyone is craving an incredible burger and great service.
Bad experience. There was something wrong with the temperature. We were cold all the night as we couldn't even take of our coats. I will never go there again unless I hear they have found a way to set up temperature of the room.
"Pretty big portions, good for family style.  Walnut shrimp's is 90% batter and 10% shrimp. Recommend the fish filet and jelly fish."
"Excellent for Take-out or Delivery.  The food is authentic. The ingredients are incredibly fresh - a necessity in Thai cuisine.  The pad thai is perfect, the green and red curries are consistent and delicious.   Eating in, however, avoid it! The decor is dated and tacky, not a pleasant environment to dine, although the servers are all pleasant."
"Definitely not the best looking places and the food was just OK. Crab rangoons were disgusting, I couldn't even eat them and the chicken and broccoli was weird tasting, the gravy was really thick and the rice wasn't the best i've ever had. It took five minutes to be greeted and to order my food. Will I go back, NO!"
"Tacos were good, service was good. Neither were great. I've been here twice and I like the tacos and the sauce caddie. Oh my god why did you rate it so low? It's a Mexican restaurant and they had nothing spicy. Nothing. I asked and I was greeted with a shrug. I asked other employees, another shrug. "" you mean you have no spicy salsa, sauce, nothing spicy!!!"" "" no sorry sir this is Scottsdale"". I'm not a spicy freak to be clear. They don't have Tabasco or anything even close to being hot. They have  ""habanero oil"". When I asked if it was hot the sever told me ""only if you think vegetable oil is hot cause that's what it is"" she was telling the truth. Literally! I'll pass next time."
"First, I love barbecue so. Second, I love any place that serves you a pile of meat on a tray. I am a simple creature.   Naked BBQ was fun, fast, and tasty. The staff was ridiculously nice and fun. As for the food, the sides are bit lackluster and need a bit more of a spicy punch or additional creamy, fatty goodness.  But, that is totally okay as the meat is the real star here. We tried four options, and we agreed that we both liked the brisket the most. Pulled pork and chicken were tasty as well. Overall, it was a fun, casual lunch with the before mentioned meat on a tray. I would totally stop by here for lunch or a brisket pick-up adventure again."
"This was my first time here. I tried the salmon enchiladas with brown rice and Cajun beans.  Salmon is a tricky fish as I have mentioned in previous reviews. I was happy to taste well cooked and tender salmon. The red enchilada sauce was spicy, but not unbearable.   The Cajun beans were also spicy but tender. They were made with white beans. These beans had the right kind of tenderness to indicate they were not canned beans.  The brown rice was regular wheat rice. This is a great place for some Baja fish."
Came here on a Wednesday afternoon and Jessica and Kailey were amazing! Drinks were ice cold and perfect!!! The staff is so nice and are so fun!!!! Love this Place!
"Palermo's was a pretty decent pizza for the price. I got the chicken fingers and pizza special for $12, which was a great deal. The delivery was a bit slow but free, so no complaints there. I'd order again."
"When.she told me that the oven is 2,000 degrees so it only takes the pizza 90 seconds to cook and my order would be ready in 5 minutes I should have hung up the phone! by the time I got it home it was rubbery. (Is that a word?) Anyway, Yuck! We won't be back."
"So, this is actually not my first time here... came here a few times already and food is pretty good.  No complaints at all.  You come here for the curries and their rotis.    We ordered the beef brisket curry, a fried rice and 2 extra orders of roti.  I wish there was just a bit more beef in the curry.  Other than that, things were pretty good.  A little on the expensive side.  The portions were a bit small for the prices they are charging.  I guess they can get away with it, their food is pretty good after all.  Will I come back...  yes.  But will not go out of way to come here.  I don't usually have cravings for curry (never did).    I am always finding things on the small side lately... no idea why!"
"No different to other reviews.  Tried the fish tacos and churro, definitely a superior Mexican/ taco joint around in the city"
Omg ! It was not good at all I usually don't give horrible reviews but my father got sick from the vermicelli seafood soup! The seafood was not fresh and was going bad !!!! My pho the soup base was alright but the meat was getting stenchy and you k ow it was getting rotten !!
"Came here after a concert at MGM...service was excellent, food was great and we got to sit near the band members we had just seen and got a couple of autographs..how cool was that."
Denny's food at Beverly Hills prices.   One star is for the decor not the food.   Worst eggs Benedict I have had in my entire life. Bacon is dry. Hollandaise sauce is tasteless and bland. Same for my other half.  Belgian Waffle saggy. Whipped cream from 99 cent store. Maple syrup is liquid sugar with water.  Very  dissaiponting breakfast !!!
"We order out at work every week and got their menu in the mail and gave them a try last week.  Pizza, hoagies, salads and pasta dishes were ordered with no evidence leftover shortly after delivery.  I had pepperoni pizza and it was delicious.  Thinner crust than other places and light on the sauce, how I prefer my pizza.  Coworkers who had other food items enjoyed their lunch too.  Looking forward to trying other menu items!"
"Sicilian pizza here is amazing, as is the Alfredo sauce. Food and service are both great. Ordered pizza and cheesy bread for pick up, and everything was ready when I got there, no extra wait. Will definitely be back to try some of the other items on the menu :)"
I have had a craving for Quiznos for quite sometime. Decided to stop in here and try this store out....Quiznos once again satisfied my lunch cravings! The worker was super polite and made my sandwich with all my customizations on point. Thank you Quiznos! Keep up the good work and please open up more locations!
"Not great. Food was stodgy and fairly tasteless, and some dishes were cold. Can't really ask for too much out of a lunch buffet but surely tasting of something ought to be the first thing one aims for in food.  Save your calories for something else."
"Hands down worst gluten free cupcake I've ever had. I cannot believe anyone would associate that product with their name, it was terrible.  Not only are all the other bakery's gluten free cupcakes superior to this one, but so are the grocery store box mixes like the gluten free Betty Crocker or Pilsburry. This was the first time I've ever thrown away dessert half-way through, I always finish or save it for later. The vanilla flavor wasn't the problem. It was so dry, that I had to take a sip of water with each bite because it would get stuck in my throat. If you're at Fashion Square and craving a gluten free treat, do yourself a favor and go to the Macaroon place. I'm disappointed, especially considering the cupcake was $5 after tax. The one star is for gluten free cupcakes only, as I have not (and cannot) try a regular one."
"Frankly disappointed. Guy is one of my favorite chefs i know, he's so cool and i love his since of humor. but his menu is lacking to me. its so concentrated which can be good... if the quality can hold up to it. i got the bacon cheese burger and i could have gotten the same thing at half the price 3 blocks down the strip. seasonings were bland and LOTS of grease. the reason your getting 3 starts Guy is because I'm more the sure this restaurant doesn't represent you very well."
"Had them last night. Great morning left overs. The staff is polite and courteous. I love their beef Mongolian. I feel like they bread their chicken too much it is mushy. BUT great place, fast, good, and clean!"
"Amazing pizza!!! Although they did forget my cheese sticks I forgive them, but don't let it happen again :)"
Just okay. Was expecting more based on a friends  referral but the food was average and the service was slow and left me disappointed. $38 for a steak so I expected much more. The Brussel sprouts small plate was on point but overall would not return to this spot.
Very fast to go service. The pad thai is made from bigger noodles than i'm used to but had a very good flavor
This place is awesome!! The atmosphere is very cozy and if you are a veteran you whole meal is free! I've been in the military for almost 4 years and have never been to a place that has offered something like that to veterans. It was a pleasant surprise. The staff is very nice and the food is great!! Definitely worth the stop!!
first off i called and the guy barley spoke any english then i had ordered a pizza and had decided to cancel so 2 minutes later i called and canceled but they still charged my credit card so i called and ask for a refund and they pretty much told me too bad so beware of this and i would suggest romas pizza very good and family owned
Great quality of food!! The plates looked very clean and appetizing. The fish were fresh and was well proportioned with the rice - which I'm kind of particular about. Very nice service as well.  Parking is a bit tight and there is also limited seating especially during peak dinner hours.  Definitely would like to try take-out next time.
Perfect place to relax after our Red Rock adventures!!  Great drinks and great food.  Definitely try the Philly Fries.  Sit in Sarah's section!  First time having her serve us.  Very friendly and attentive!!  Thanks!!
"It use to be that when I have my annual vacation to Vegas with either my girlfriends or husband, Koi was the place to go to get my sushi needs.   Ever since I went to Social House, I certainly changed my mind about going to Koi again!    My girl friend and I went to Social House last Saturday a little before 5, before the restaurant opened for dinner.  The host was very friendly and informed us that the restaurant was not opened for dinner yet.  My girl friend and I each had a a cocktail while we waited.  Wow! I loved their ""Socialite"" cocktail and my girlfriend was amazed by their ""lycheetini"".  Both drinks were incredible!! This definitely gave us a boost of confidence about the meal we were about to have.   When it was time for dinner we picked a bottle of sparkling sake called ""hana awaka""....it was sincerely the best sparkling sake we've ever had.  It was a little pricey (then again, what's not pricey in Vegas?) but it was definitely an amazing experience to try something new!   The food, oh the food was just so incredible.  My favorites were hamachi jalapeno, hamachi tartar, miso cod lettuce cups, and uni.  All of the dishes have nice portion since it's meant to be shared, which I thought was a great concept!  The food was just so fresh and nicely flavored we actually ordered some dishes again!  My girl friend and I were definitely in sushi heaven.    Everyone in the restaurant were extremely friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be working there.  The manager came to ask us twice to see if we were satisfied with the food and if we were having a good time.  My water never went below half empty as the water and busboy constantly refills it as soon as I drank some.  For someone who drinks a lot of water with my meal and so I'm constantly asking for more water, this is a huge plus for me.     The ambiance was amazing.  We enjoyed the trendy music but it was not too loud we couldn't hear our own conversation.   Overall, we had an incredible experience dining at social house.  It was such a fantastic meal my girl friend and I were still talking about it half an house after we walked out of the restaurant!  This is definitely one place we have to visit every time we go to Vegas!"
"Of course the food is good, employees are nice but I have never been to a slower Chick-fil-A in my life. I sat through the drive thru for 20 mins. Chick-fil-A is always super fast but these people seemed to have zero urgency. Extremely annoying."
Wow!!! What a place. Took the kids here after Easter Brunch and had a great time. Can get a little pricey if not careful.  It took me an extra order of doughnut holes to convince them to leave!
"Travel weary and need of food - as I walked out my hotel heard some excellent acoustic music - enjoying some music ,  turns out it was $5 burger night - bonus -  California burger was juicy and the gauc and grilled onion perfect - i also tried the tortilla soup which i enjoyed. I also enjoyed the skinny crunchy fries and the chilled and crisp pickle The service was fast and friendly.  When i back to PHX and near the convention center I'll come again"
"I'm a sucker for a good falafel,  and this place delivers. Ordered the combo with a side of hummus. Tasty,  fresh falafel and good but a little loose hummus. Would definitely come here again."
"Been here a few times, the service is super slow just to order a coffee. Coffee prices are not cheap. Ive had the sandwiches which are pretty good but heavy. Most people come here to use the free wifi and they sit for hours drinking water. Not my favourite place and the inside could be fixed up a little more."
As a Mexican born and raised in California I'm sorry this place was horrible!! The chili had a strange taste !! We just threw it away! And bought hamburgers from B K and that says a lot!! Don't waste your time!!!  It could have been an off day for them!!  Anyways as we ordered through the Drive thru I was practically yelling thinking Omgosh really!!  Never again!!   If you try it let me know if you like it ok lol
Loved the one out Rea Rd and now thrilled they are open near my house.
"Good Korean grill near Eaton Centre. The marinate is good. We got beef, ox liver, salmon, fish fillet, chicken, pork, pork belly. The fish fillet was bland and liver was meh. Salmon and chicken was really flavourable. Such a fun place to eat at for a date or group of friends. Even alone. No judgments here.  The staff is attentive, nice and considerate. Bigger groups will most likely be seated on the second floor which is way bigger. Caution: will smell like BBQ grill after."
"Not a fan. Overpriced, over cooked bland burgers. Everything is extra (fries, onion rings)."
"I cam here for a late dinner/ drinks for a work social. The staff was very pleasant and the atmosphere was great. TV's surrounding the walls which is always a plus in my books.   We started with drinks, most were to shy to try the spiked milkshakes and stick to beer. But one brave sole tried the chocolate monkey milkshake, It looked delicious!  The food was great, they sure do know how to make a burger, the Kobe beef burger was my choice and it was fantastic! A huge selection of toppings to add.  The one downfall to this place is the bathrooms are in the basement and are by no means roomy. In fact I smacked my head off the roof as I tried to squeeze my way into the stalls.     Cool place worth a try if you are in the area"
"Chilis is a bar and grill restaurant. It offers a dining area for you to sit in and at a table. It also gives you a bar so you can just sit at and enjoy drinks that have been made by the bartender. It offers a variety of food. From entrees like burgers, steak, and fish, and if you are not feeling to hungry then they have appetizers like hot wings, sliders, chips and salsa and so many more options. Also they allow you to order your food from home and pick it up and take it home. I personally like that there is so many options to choose from on the menu. I like how they also cater to the needs of someone trying to be healthy and watch their diet by adding healthy items to the menu. The staff is great and helpful. They don't hang around, and watch you eat. They check in at appropriate times to refill your drinks and ask how you're doing. The only thing I dislike is the waiting time. I usually have to wait 30 minutes to be seated. But that is because I usually go on the weekends, so it is understandable. I would give this restaurant 4 out of 5 stars."
Comfortable surroundings. Great service. Food was very good. Defiantly will be back to try the rest of the menu and for dinner as well.
"Local breeze is one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  My bf and I go all the time for brunch, and they also have really good burgers too.  My favorite part about this place is that they have a dog friendly patio.  They usually bring the dogs little dog bowls with water and sometimes even a cookie!  Try the coca cola ham omelet for brunch....AH-MAZING!"
"7/15/17. Came to Vegas to celebrate a milestone birthday - and Saturday just seemed to want us to be at Encore Beach Club the entire day/night. First, we attended Diplo, with some promoter price tickets for the guys and the ladies on a free list. Came around 11 to avoid the line - easy-peasy. We ate there, while letting the sunscreen dry, then spent the whole afternoon dancing and splashing. The staff was great, the people as well-  there was hard partying but no fights or any such ratchetness, just people from all over having the time of our lives. The rave-booty was twerk-tacular. There were spankings. The bartenders seemed to be having more fun than the people drinking. All I saw were smiles. You could see Diplo from any of the pools, except perhaps the front middle as people stand and dance in front of the DJ. We danced with our group of 8 (4 couples) and met plenty of nice people.   As more of my group came in from all over, we came back for Marshmello Saturday night (Nightswim!), whom I hadn't seen since EDC last year. We got a great table on a lily-pad off the pool (not on the pool) just in case there was gratuitous splashing, we'd want a dry drinking spot haha. Our view was fantastic, table was perfect, the VIP even invited us into the small VIP pool behind us.   We got a great package that started with 2 magnums of grey goose, which did great for our group. I was impressed how they handled both my large group (12 on table, 14 total that night) and the speed-bump of my credit-card declining as I forgot to tell the bank I was leaving the state. My Host Alexia, beholder of a supernatural beauty, waited patiently and kindly while I called the card and had them over-ride the security hold. She was calm and pleasant, and simply said ""this happens all the time."" (This was in stark contrast to the treatment at Omnia the night before where the bartender threatened to have my friend arrested when his card declined).   Alexia and her runner, damn I totally forgot his name (even he was a really nice guy), treated us incredibly well. She came back and poured drinks throughout the night, not just the obligatory first round. They also made sure we stayed hydrated! Super important when it's 100 at night. They gave us just the right amount of attention and class.   Thank you guys, and special thanks to Alvin for the rockstar treatment at the door. Saturday night was the cherry on top of my birthday weekend!! Truly I don't expect anything less from Encore/Wynn (XS, Surrender/Encore Beach Club) - I never get anything less than the best experience there, over the span of years that I have both attended with tickets and tables. They are the best, they will always be the best.   Thanks again! :-)"
The gelato here is sent from the gods themselves.   Just kidding. Desyree makes everything that goes into the gelato herself. Same difference right?
"Nestled in what is (for now) a relatively sleepy corner of Downtown, Urban Bodega (aka URBO) feels like something of a throwback to some of the small convenience stores I used to see line the Roosevelt Row neighborhood.  Back when Downtown was still a neighborhood where only the most diehard entrepreneurs dared to tread, you could find one of these small neighborhood shops selling everything from wine and beer, to snacks, to cooking essentials, and even a few household cleaning items.  The relatively new Pure Fillmore apartment complex is currently the first of what will undoubtedly be many new apartment and condo complexes lining 7th Avenue in Downtown.  But for now, the nearest full sized grocery store requires a car.  All the more reason URBO's location makes sense.  You'll find URBO on the bottom floor of the Pure Fillmore Apartments on Fillmore Street just east of 7th Avenue.  The brainchild of DeSoto Central Market alum Shawn Connelly, you enter here through the front patio area (where there's seating for eight by the way).  Inside, its a whole lot of stuff mixed into a small space.  Behind the counter, you can get coffee, tea, or even a sandwich made on the spot.  In front of the counter, it's essentially a small independent convenience store with many of the things you'd expect.  Candy bars, meds, condiments, snacks, microwavable items, beer, wine, soda, as well as odds and ends like tissue paper, shampoo, and storage bags.  I can well imagine some Downtown college students living in the apartments upstairs too hung over or too tired to drive two miles to Safeway and instead opting for a stop here.  For my first stop here on a Saturday morning, I opted to get a quick morning pick me up.  A tea and a sandwich.  I got their Salted Caramel Iced Tea (also available hot) and their Turkey Sausage Egg & Cheese sandwich on an english muffin.  Both made to order.  Total cost including tax: $10.  Now to be fair, they prepared the sandwich in part using a microwave so we're not talking gourmet here.  Still, the sandwich hit the spot and the sausage in particular was very tasty.  I was also very happy with the tea.  Almost tasted like a southern style sweet tea of sorts with those caramel accents.  A solid breakfast.  So there you have it.  A locally owned business filling a need in an emerging neighborhood.  Nothing pretentious.  Just a good, straight forward, progressive independent convenience store.  Even if you don't live in this quiet corner of Downtown, its worth a look.  Or a sip and bite and it was in my case."
"Went to Alchemy today because my friend was craving a burger. I had never dined here before, but she had and suggested it. I was thoroughly impressed. She had the bison burger which was to die for, I had a bite and instantly wanted another. I ordered the BLFT and it was loaded with bacon and flavor. I had some minor issues with it, first being that there was just a little too much aioli on the bread and second that the fried tomato was a red tomato and not a green tomato. I just found the texture of the tomato unappetizing. I also enjoyed their bloody mary and they have a nice local, craft beer selection. For dessert we had the espresso torte and it was one of the best I have ever had. Service was also spot on and I will be returning soon to get the bison burger for myself!"
"This was a great find near Pittsburgh alternative to down town scene. Ambiance was great on the deck by the river, and service was excellent (Thanks Melisa for history lessens!). Seafood including Oysters were fresh and well prepared. Price was reasonable for ""Prefix"" menu including scrumptious dessert.  What an evening to end a fantastic summer day in Pittsburgh."
"Looking for a big, hearty breakfast? Then look no further because this place has got exactly what you're looking for (and for a pretty reasonable price). I went here with my friend after a night of *ahem* good old Madison weekend fun, and this was exactly what we needed. I got the eggs mornay, which has this sausage patty and poached eggs with this very nice sauce on top of an English muffin. And if that wasn't enough carbs for you, it comes with a generous helping of fried potatoes. Good stuff.  Also a random note: despite its appearance as an old fashioned diner, I got a very hipster-y vibe from it once I got in."
"Nothing special here. It's about what you'd expect out of a Mongolian Barbecue style chain. Choose your base meat and carbohydrate (but not portions, that is set), add your choice of vegetables, then watch them roast it in front of you. I went with chicken and rice noodles, and a ginger garlic sauce. The finished product tasted like propane. The guys frying everything up work hard, but their efforts are about the best thing you can say about this place. I still like it better than Noodlecat, though, as it doesn't seem to take itself seriously. Many of the Kanji on the wall are backwards/upside down."
"Loved this place!  The food was very good and the drinks were fantastic but more importantly the service was outstanding.  We all started with cocktails - Margaritas and Mojitos.  The Margarita was made with bourbon and rimed with crushed bacon and salt (yes I said bacon).  The Mojitos were fresh and minty.  The one thing I we all really like about the drinks was that they were not too sweet.    We ordered two apps for the table - Lobster Fritters and Braised beef short rib poutine.  OMG the poutine was out of this world!!  The fritters were good but there was no lobster flavor.  I think next time I would just order the vegetable fritters.  For mains we had fried fish tacos, steak burrito, jambalaya and grilled pork chop with red potato salad.  The jambalaya and the pork chop were features. The burritos was very nice.  The steak was a nice medium rare and it came with guacamole and lime crema.  Fish Tacos were delish!  The corn tortillas really make a difference.  The pork chop feature was really good.  My friend found it to be a little fatty but for those of us who love pork fat it was perfect.  The only dish that fell short was the Jambalya.  The sausage in the dish had great flavor but the overall dish didn't seem to come together.    You would think by now we would be full but we sucked it up and ordered dessert. Two sweet potato pies, beignets and a Patron creme brulee.  My word it was good. The sweet potato pie was more of a bread pudding with a bourbon carmel sauce.  The creme brulee was one of the best I've had - it had a lovely fresh citrus flavor.  The beignets were tougher than I expected but still good.  I would like to point something out about this place.  No the food isn't cheap but the quality of the ingredients justifies the cost.  Our meal with tax and tip was $200 (for four).  The food was really good but what sets them apart is the service.  The restuarant was fairly busy and there was only one waiter who had the assitance of the owners Amy and Albert.  Yes there were times when we seemed to be waiting awhile for things but they made sure that we never felt forgotton.  They went out of their way to talk to us and make us feel welcome.  I've been to some really nice restaurants and had some incredible food but I've never been made to feel as welcome as did at The Combine Eatery."
"The atmosphere may be what you'd expect of a bar in the middle of a suburban development, but the food and drink are pretty good.   Our friends love their beer, we gushed over their root beer. The malted berry drink was perfect for lightweights.   The Wisco Porker pizza was tasty and full of meat - just as you would want and expect.   Nice bonus - Free shots after touchdowns during Badger games. Woop!"
"Atmosphere is nice, decor is cute and staff is really nice. The most important thing is that the food is BOMB. I got a buche taco, al pastor taco, and Mexican corn on the cob. The al pastor taco was the best out of all of them, with lots of juicy meat despite it looking weird and dry on the meat spinner (is that what it's called?). Buche taco didn't have as much meat which was kinda sad. The corn was delicious however the amount of parmesan cheese on top killed it a bit. The mole fries are AMAZING. Ten out of ten will come back for them."
"As an ex-NYer, I have a pretty high standard of bagel. These did not disappoint, but I wouldn't say they are truly singular in their yumminess. My review is based solely on these, as we did not try the desserts or anything else. Some of the bagels seemed ""fresher"" than others, and if you've ever had a NYC bagel before 8am, you know the expectations I have. I also feel like the bagels were kinda skinny, and the holes were big. I'm used to really fat, chewy but pillowy ones. Sigh.  But it really pains me to give anything lower than 4 stars, as they have a lot of traditional Jewish/NYC deli delicacies, which you really don't see out here in LV. If that is your thing, you really should check it out! The rye bread with caraway seeds looked good. The dessert section also piqued my interest. Please don't get a black & white cookie - Hell will freeze over before anyone ever likes those, trust me.  The shop is located in the weirdest shopping complex - it feels like a dr's office belongs here. Inside, it was pretty poppin' (it was Sunday), but the line wasn't bad.   All in all, I will be back again to try more."
We only sampled a few small plates but they were good. The staff was helpful but their beer selection is lacking.  We sat on the patio and it was okay but they need to invest in some plants for their planters. Just having the old dead plants really does not help the ambiance of a concrete patio.
"This review is only for take out matza ball soup. Real hot and tasty on rainy day. Some suggestions, though:  have sturdier containers for hot soup. Clear plastic are flimsy and can cause burns.  Need plastic soup spoons, teaspoons say we didn't plan for soup!  Also, I think cashier said bagel chips come with soup, but none were in bag. Indoor parking is the best on rainy days.  A good work in progress."
3 of us were planning to go to burger bar inside mandalay bay.  but we missed the exit as there was construction and somehow ended up on the 215....and when we got off we saw Chicken Bonz....  So instead of fighting the traffic onto the strip we decided to try it out.  Price wasn't too bad...all you can eat wings for like $13.  I had the garlic parmesan which seemed a little bland.  Then I tried the Hot Wings...and it was kind of spicy....not too bad.  The ranch was a bit watery...  As the others mentioned these are the big wing versions.....so you get a lot of meat.  I personally prefer the small crispy kind...  For the price it isn't bad....but it just didnt do it for me....
"Seems old and tired!   I ate here frequently about 20 years ago and returned for happy hour this year.  This used to be a good place many years ago, but too many great restaurants have opened in recent years to eat here.  Strange rules about what you can eat in the bar area.  Food just meh."
"Was recommended to try this place by few people and today was my first time here. All I can say is, I am coming back very soon.  SERVICE Wasn't sure if the guy was the owner but he was friendly and talked story while we waited for our food. Loved it!! Food came out within 10 min.   FOOD Tried hamburger steak and it was so delicious. Gravy/sauce they put on the hamburger steak was perfect! Also came with onion rings on top which I love. Chicken katsu was amazing! Chicken katsu here is crunchy and surprisingly has a flavor by itself that you really don't need a sauce for it. Best chicken katsu I had.   OVERALL It was a journey to get to this place as it took about 30min from my house but the service and food here made it worth the drive. I also love how they had a poster of Keali'i Reichel. (They had other posters but Keali'i Reichel happens to be my favorite). Place is clean, service is fast and friendly and food is delicious. What more could you ask for?"
"Everything we ordered was completely disgusting. We ordered from the late night menu, I got the veggie fajitas beans and rice. They left out my tortillas in my Togo order the beans and rice were disgusting. My best friend ordered the fish tacos which ended up being some sort of strange shredded fish. My boyfriend got the salmon salad, which was ok but would've been better but the salmon was dry. They left out my garlic fries and on top of all of this disgusting food it was 91$!!! I will never eat here ever again"
"So I chose this place because they were open at the time I wanted to go pick up dinner at 4pm.  Ordered a Papaya salad and Pad Thai. They asked how I wanted it Mild Medium or Hot.  I stayed safe and said mild for both.  Well, when I got home and opened up the containers--of which they stupidly put them in one bag-dumb because papaya salad is always cold- I had to remove it in the car before heading home.  The Papaya salad was not evenly cut...their shredder is not working and it is supposed to be picked up like speghetti...this was clumps of papaya shredded half way. ALL I COULD TASTE WAS ONION. ONION...like eating a clumpy mouthful of ONION.  Horrid.  The Pad Thai had dry pieces of chicken and ZERO seasoning.  AWFUL. CRAP.  Waste of $17. NEVER BE BACK. They cannot produce Thai food that is worthy.  Instead of driving back to the place to return this...I'm writing this review. STAY AWAY.  Should have gone to Thai Plates or tried another place..these guys were the only ones open at the time I wanted food.  BAD DECISION. STAY AWAY. Headed to the fridge to eat crackers and cheese. TICKED."
"I dined at P.J.'s last weekend.  I had heard many great things about their food and service, so I had to check it out.  I like the atmosphere of the restaurant and that they have a little pseudo patio as well.  It was nice sitting out there and people watching all of the crazy people who come through the Forum Shops.  Our server was very friendly, but did seem a little awkward and didn't make a lot of eye contact.  His recommendations were spot on and we enjoyed all of our food.  I over heard other servers asking tables where they were from, and it was a little overboard.  EVERY person who came to a table asked that question.  The poor table next to us must've answered 15 times.  Here is a little tip: if the hostess asks, she should then communicate it to the server. So when the server approaches the table he/she can say ""hey, I heard you are visiting from ____, welcome!"" Much more personal.  Anyhow, on to the food!!  We started out sharing the french onion soup, a caesar salad and the tater tots.  All were delicious.  The croutons were homemade on the salad and very flavorful.  The soup was served in a litte crock and was very cheesy.  The tater tots were not my favorite in town, but they are still good.  They are homemade and served with tomato jelly instead of ketchup.  Main Course:  I had the delmonico ribeye, oscar style.  The steak was done perfectly and the crab meat and bernaise were amazing.  I could barely eat 1/2 of my meat!  My guest had the lobster mac n' cheese, which is very different, but very delicious.  There was plenty of lobster meat and it was a large portion.  There was spinach, mushrooms and other things mixed in, which is different.  We had a side of asparagus, which was amazing.  Cooked perfectly al dente.  We also had the ""canon"" potato on the side, upon recommenation from our server.  I am SO glad I tried this.  It is actually an English food called ""bubble and squeak."" Mashed potatoes are sauteed with bacon and chopped cabbage and then topped with a cheese sauce.  Sounds strange, but it was a great combination!  I would go back for that dish alone.  For dessert we shared the fresh apple cobbler topped with cinammon ice cream.  It was warm and delicious, like an apple pie fresh out of the oven.  Overall, I love the place.  They have a raw bar that often has happy hour specials for $1 oysters.  It is not too casual, but also not fussy.  Everyone is very friendly and welcoming and the food is great!"
"Ugh here we go.. this is my second time ordering from crepe club through Postmates. Both times big let down. I order through Postmates several times a week and rarely ever have any issues so I know it's nothing they could of prevented unless the drivers start sampling the food and drinks before delivery. I ordered the regular chicken florentine - crepe was cold, doughy and undercooked. It was generously stuffed, almost too much. Spinach was fresh, but not cooked so it was like eating a salad in my crepe...the mushrooms, clearly were canned precooked mushrooms. I'm not totally offended by them, but when you put a ton in a raw crepe...not really tasty. Iced latte- there is no option to NOT add flavoring which is baffling in itself. Flavoring should be a option not a requirement. Given I can't stand sugar filled syrup pretending to be caramel in my coffee, in the special notes section, I specifically asked NO flavoring, and add a extra shot. Guess who got a caramel syrup latte?  This girl. Why even have the special requests field if you aren't going to read it? This happened the first time I ordered. I don't know if they can't see the notes or figure it can be put on Postmates. It's all very confusing. Chocolate croissant- tasty, seemed fresh. Nothing special but compared to my $10 crepe and watered down overly flavored latte it shined.  Dear management, read your reviews. Common theme, crepes are undercooked. If you are going to be so bold to name your establishment after a certain food, you best knock it out of the park. IHOP makes a better chicken Florentine crepe. That's shameful. I gave it two shots both were overpriced let downs. Their space can't seem to keep a business longer than 2 years. I'll be shocked if they stick around."
"I loved the ambiance of this restaurant.  The food was amazing and the service was excellent. We started with the Famous Roy's Hawaiian Martini, Lobster Potstickers for apps, Scallops and Swordfish for our entrees and everything was cooked to perfection.  If you are a dessert lover like I am... especially CAKE, you must try the Pineapple Upside Down Cake served a la mode...SO Good!  This was  my first time, but I will definitely dine at Roy's again!"
"This place gets crowded. Waited 20 min for a table at 12:30pm during the lunch rush. it clears out after 1:30pm, no waiting after the lunch rush. The portions are HUGE here with the typical Deli style sandwiches and bagels.  The bakery has great items too."
"Great Columbian street food place.  A lot of options in the place that it's located, but I think we chose right.  We got the hot dogs, Columbian style, empanada and yucca.  All great!!"
"Had a nice date here with the bae on Friday night.  We ordered a couple of pints and enjoyed the vibe of this place overall.  To share, we decided on the fried jerk chicken wings, which were delicious. Bae ordered the baseball steak and I opted for a soup and salad.  I tried a bite of the steak which was very tasty and the side of smashed/fried red potatoes were oh so good. I enjoyed my french onion soup and arugula salad as well.  I would return if I was in the area again :)"
"Neighborhood bar  & grill featuring volleyball courts and outdoor patio/bar. Atmosphere is great, but food is just ok. Wings are best bet... stay away from steaks. Service is sub par at best... they are nice, but there are a ton of waitresses but they still take forever to wait on you and forget refills, etc.  Bar is empty most of time during summer when everyone is outside playing volleyball"
Service was great. The food was disgusting. Ordered clam chowder and it was barely warm. Then ordered fried shrimp and the shrimp was not deveined. Seriously?! I'm paying $18.99 for fried shrimp with the poop vein still intact?! Ugh. Also ordered plain iced tea and it was frothy and super bitter. Definitely not at all impressed and won't be returning.
Yikes don't try and get a burrito without meat and cheese you would have thought I asked for the moon!  I was told that the cooks would do it this one time but don't come back on the weekend and expect that to happen again.  How hard is it to remove something from an item That has to be assembled anyhow?  Our waitress made a huge deal out of it and that we should be pretty grateful they were willing to do it.
"Bricco is a local Junction restaurant that I truly would like to support. ..but it confuses me. There is a meticulous attention to detail about restaurant decor. However in a couple of visits with friends,  one of four in the group wasn't happy with what they selected...while the other three were thrilled. Is the Chef inconsistent or just trying too hard to be creative? I am always drawn to a menu with wine pairings. On new year last though, Bricco had a menu that didn't flow well and some of the wine pairings just didn't make sense to the point of requesting (and thankfully receiving) a replacement wine. I would have lost hope except the main was a cut of beef with an Italian pairing that was to die for! Lets hope for more consistency and the locals will fill the room."
"Located next to the Costco near Woodbine & Hwy 7.  Looks like lots of people go for dim sum and grocery shopping without having to move the car.  However, unless you take advantage of their early bird pricing (we did not), not that great a place for dim sum...better quality/price choices are readily available.  Our party of four paid $57 all in for 8 so-so dim sum dishes plus a noodle plate."
"Ok, I've been living in Madison for over a year, and had been trying to find a place with decent but inexpensive chinese food. Fugu was ok, but overpriced and their delivery is slow. Ichiban seemed just ok. I've tried others with no luck. Finally I tried double 10, and I'm soooooo happy! It's really good, but also way cheaper than anything else I've found in town. I really liked the garlic sauce they have. They also had super fast service. This is my new go to Chinese place!"
"First time here and everything was amazing. What a wonderful little gem we found in this place. Looks like not much out front but it's very charming and original in back. Beautiful patio and food was fabulous. Lunch today but we will be back to try more.  Breakfast looks incredible. Plus, they are Detroit Tiger fans!  Added bonus!!!"
"Picture Homer Simpson when he sees something really delicious that he wants to eat.  His eyes close a bit, his mouth waters profusely, and he makes that mouthwatering gargling sound.  Do you have the image in your head?  Well, that's probably me exactly when I think about eating at Jimmy's!  It's so delicious that whenever I think about it, I have an instant craving!  The amount of food you get for the price is unbelievable!  The donairs and shawarmas are so big I struggle to finish one.  Even when I'm stuffed to the brim, I can't bring myself to throw any away, so I always make myself sick by force feeding the remaining wrap into my mouth.  I wouldn't for one second dream of wasting a Jimmy donair.  I know that everyone who goes here will all be saying the same thing: it's so delicious and marvelous that nothing else will ever be satisfying again!  The first time I went in here I had no clue what I was doing or what I wanted to eat.  Lucky for me, Jimmy was behind the counter serving people and he pointed me in the right direction of something yummy.  He was super friendly and extremely helpful.  Don't tell Jimmy but I kind of have a little crush on him.  Maybe that's why I keep going back.  Nah, it's because of how fantastic the food is.  Besides the donairs and shawarmas, they also have a bunch of little desserts you can buy.  There is a whole display of baklava and other yummy looking treats.  Along with the food, Jimmy's is also a great place to go if you want to buy some shisha or hookah pipes.  They have a large assortment of different sizes and shapes, and all the flavours that you can imagine smoking.  I seriously love Jimmy's so much.  I miss the days when a friend used to live behind the store and we ate there almost everyday.  Now I have to go a little out of my way to get there, but it's totally worth it every time.  I love Jimmy's so much and I'm positive that everyone who goes there loves it too.  It's just one of those awesome finds that everyone in the world should know about.  *insert Homer Simpson drooling here*"
"Pretty bad. Was this place good at one time? For the price I paid, I expected something much better.  Two kids and an adult on a Friday nught. $86. Unbelievable. No selection of food. Quality of food sucks.  Only thing good was almond bread pudding."
"A hidden gem! Initially I thought this was a drive thru coffee stand. To my surprise they serve breakfast, lunch dinner and happy hour. An adorable pet friendly patio that was busy what look like with local patrons. Inside tables and bar seating. Cozy fit and counter service for lunch. Check out the unique bathroom. The entire staff was extremely friendly and going the extra mile to make every guest welcome."
"It was great!    This place was really small, but I LOVED it, it was comfortable and a friendly environment. The kitchen is right there, its amazing, you can see what they are doing, the only thing that could be off putting is that this is Arizona and it is summer, so watching from the kitchen bar can get pretty warm, but then, just don't sit there.    My good friend loves the place and found it a few years before. So he recommended a few things, we had a bottle of Riesling with our baked Bree and blackberry (I think it was jam) it was amazing. Truly, and I am very particular about the types of cheese I'm okay with (food allergies)    We were just catching up, so we didn't decide immediately that we would stay for dinner, but, why not, I choose the pasta with lobster in an amazing carrot butter sauce and he had the standing Shepard's pie, you have to see it to believe how amazing it is.     Our food was amazing, we had a second bottle of wine, which was also amazing and although my friend finished all of his food, I've never been able to finish a full plate of pasta in one sitting, so I brought some home. I actually ate the left overs, which is unlike me.     The owner talked to us for a bit, he was really helpful, talked to me a bit about my emerging interests in making wine/beer and different outlets that would be helpful and reasonably priced. I didn't expect that, it was really nice of him to talk about their wide selection of wines, beers and other interesting concoctions. I wish that I had more time to try a couple of them.    I will have to go back, sometime soon."
"I initially passed the place up since it is nestled in a typical strip mall off next to a Kinko's just off Rural Road on E University.  I was meeting a friend for a quick, inexpensive and hopefully tasty pre-movie dinner at the Valley Art Theater on Mill.  The decor was what I would call, the ""basic, no frills cafeteria like set up"" that can be found in many Indian and Thai restaurants I have frequented.  Practical and comfortable.  The staff was friendly and welcoming and the menu had typical Indian fare. We shared the appetizers, the garlic Naan and vegetable samosas, both were an enjoyable beginning.  I love eggplant, so my go to order is the Baingan Bharta with rice and that is what I had.  It was delicious, I ordered it mild and it had just the right amount of kick.  I restrained myself from not devouring the whole meal and saved enough to take home for a full meal.  As expected, the meal was a great value of $20 with tip.  Not bad for two healthy meals.  When I am craving Indian and over near Mill, I will return to the Delhi Palace again. Namaste."
"i have ordered from here 5 times. each time a different sandwich. greasy soaked texas style toast and bland as ever. they could have put anything on it to be honest, it tasted like hot grease. perfect for those who like indigestion and stomach pain. over-hyped restaurant, not worth the visit."
This place rocks my world!!!! The servers are super friendly and the food is fantastic. I come here about 2 times a week and am extremely satisfied every time. They have a great happy hour too! Denise and Maggie are the best!
"Holy Crap, what's with the bad reviews? I can't believe that this is the same place we ate dinner at last night!  We came around 5 pm ans sat on the patio. We had several servers come and ask if we were ready to order, but we weren't. We wanted fried calamari and also some hot apps, but the Hot Platter for 2 only had the grilled calamari. Our server was nice enough to substitute the fried calamari for us at no extra charge.   I had a glass of nice refreshing Greek white that hit the spot. The Greek Salad we had was super fresh and crunchy with a perfect dressing and just the right amount of feta.  The platter had 2 dolomades, that were very good and had a nice mint flavour behind the grape leaf. The house made sausage had loads of lemon zest in it and was exceptionally flavourful. Spanakopita was flaky, buttery and delicious and the octopus was nice, too. I have to say that the calamari was not as tender as I would have expected, but it wasn't terrible. They also brought us some delicious hummus that was made with fresh chickpeas. They also brought a nice helping of yummy tatziki on a plate.  The service was exceptional and we rarely waited for anything we needed. Our server asked my boyfriend if he wanted another diet coke, she cleared our cutlery from the greek salad and replaced it when our platter came.   Maybe it was a fluke, but we had an absolutely great little nosh and I'd come back again anytime."
Not the chipotle it used to be compared to couple years back..they are stingy with everything now..I barely come here anymore it used to be 2-3 times a week..step it up you are a big franchise now
"Love this hidden gem!  The food is excellent, well-presented and affordable. I have tried the Kiss Taco, Kiss Papa Taco and Kiss Salad...all delicious!!"
"Great beer.Matt Cole has matured into a great craftsmen. Food is pretty good overall. Smokehouse wings are the best in C-town. The Brewben is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The root beer floats are an old timey treat for desert. Giant portions,be warned."
"Very pleased with everything I've bought here: scallops, salmon, halibut, trout.  The owner provides great customer service. They just started carrying low acid coffee which we used to have to buy from Trader Joes in Chicago. Ask to receive the fish and meat emails."
"It's pretty rare for me to write fast food reviews. But considering I have always have superb experiences, it's only fair to give them the credit they deserve. As far as I know, until now, Vegas only had one Freddy's location. I was stoked to find out the new one was opening near me. For me, fast food consists of maybe 5 places- and this is one of them.  They serve steak-burgers, so it may cost more than average, but not by much. You can get 2 different styles of burgers: A Freddy's burger that comes with pickle, mustard, and onion. (my preference) Or a California burger. Same meat, but this one comes with lettuce, tomato, onion, and a ""Freddy's sauce"" which is your typical thousand island, fry sauce, spread, etc.  They also offer Chicago style hot dogs, grilled chicken sandwiches, and desserts.  The service is always, without a doubt, amazing. They train the employees well and it shows. Good quality, good prices, and good people.  Do yourself a favor and skip Wendy's, McDonald's, and for sure pass by the Taco Bell next to this place, you won't regret it."
"I'd come here for dinner before and had a great meal but closer to when it first opened. This time, I tried lunch and did not have as wonderful of an experience.   I ordered the antipasto to start and it was served in a bowl almost as a salad on greens. It had about 3 very small pieces of Italian sausage, 2 thin slices of prosciutto, just grilled zucchini as far as grilled vegetables and was mostly greens. This was not at all a good value for the money or what I expect when I order antipasto.  I ordered the gnocchi a la Trio for my entree which was an item with a description that sounded amazing. However, the sauce was way too thin and the whole meal was fairly bland. Which is especially odd since it was supposed to be a gorgonzola cream sauce, which I expected to be very flavourful.  On another note, the manager/possible owner who was walking around seemed to run the place with an iron fist and simply not be a very nice person. At one point I heard him chew out a chef about how ""When I say something, that's it. There's no discussion."" Interestingly, he checked in with us mid-meal and was very friendly but his repor with his employees did not put be at ease and I'm less likely to visit a place because of that.  I've rated Trio 3* which is actually pretty generous considering my experience. However, the waiters were very kind and attentive and the dessert was delicious (Tiramisu). That coupled with my original visit mean I'll probably try this place out at least one more time to see if I just caught them on a bad day."
"No stars.. yes no stars... (the app made me select one to post) the complete bs I just witnessed as a customer left me with a real stale taste in my mouth. This is the first dine in experience where the stale taste wasn't caused by the food. I went with my family to this location for lunch. The place was busy which is exactly what any good store manager would want; however a good store manager would also want their customers leaving there location feeling respected, valued, & fully satisfied with their dine in experience. Our experience started out great but it slowly showed signs that it was headed down hill when our burgers came to the table before our salads and shakes. We usually frequent the Parmatown location. They seem so much more professional. When our shakes were delivered to the table the chocolate shake made it to the table but the strawberry banana shake was poured into my wifes lap. As you can imagine this feels great in an air conditioned room while wearing shorts. The shake poured straight down my wifes bare leg into her shoe and onto the floor. My wife received a borage of ""I'm sorry!""s which is awesome and conveys how the workers were feeling at the time. The most important question or worry during this situation is #1 How does the customer feel? #2 How can we help them? #3 What can we do to rectify the situation? In retrospect all we received was late food, apologies, wet pants, napkins, and a bill to pay for it all. Yes a bill! The manager came over attempting to offer apologies and a mop. Not once did she offer a solution to rectify my wifes ruined clothes and meal. I as her husband had to speak up and ask for some type of resolution. Some people have the knack to be a store manager while others just don't. This type of manager is what I commonly refer to as a floater. Floaters are managers who do just enough to maintain current numbers and current status quo. They really have no talent or abilities which are beneficial to improving the overall profitability or running of the store. When this location implements points #1,#2, &#3 they will be taking a step in the right direction. It is needless to say that we won't be back anytime soon nor recommending it."
"I had heard that this place has very good breakfast with quality ingredients and low prices. However, my husband is not a breakfast person so if you go at dinner time breakfast is still available which is something I need to remember.   We went on a Friday after a long stressful week where we had our wedding coming up a week later  and it provided comfort food for us, typically not what we would normally have but it hit the spot. I had the fried chicken and waffles so a little dinner and breakfast in one and my husband had the smaller chicken fried steak. The portions were large.   The service was very good and the food came out hot and quick.   The decor is very cute. It looks like you are in a cozy cabin.   I will def be going back for my comfort food fix!"
"I've been there twice. The first time I got a load of pastries to go (which turned out to be yummy!) and the second time I went for breakfast. Both times, the service was great and the food was great. I don't know what it's called, but there's a filo dough ""tube"" filled w/ spinach and cheeses... get it!  Their signage is practically non-existent, so they're unfortunately easy to miss. It's worth a visit.  :)"
We have been searching for a good Chinese restaurant that won't break the bank. We found it! Chin's is amazing! 3 of us went out to eat and all got a different dish and upgraded to the vegetable rice. Add 3 drinks and 6 cream cheese wontons and our bill was $33. The food was spectacular!
"A co-worker of mine kept talking about Tottie's, so last night I finally gave it a try.  I don't know if it is different dining in, because I ordered take-out, but it was good.  It didn't blow me away, but it was good.  Very similar to good chinese take-out, or maybe a notch up.  I ordered the Tottie Rolls as a starter.  They are crispy egg rolls that you wrap in a lettuce leaf, with mint and parsley.  They come with a sort-of sweet and sour sauce for dipping that was quite nice.  Or atleast I think that is how you are supposed to eat them?  I had a big take out container full of lettuce, mint and parsley, so I figured that was the drill since I didn't order a salad?  They were good.  I ordered the Tangerine Chicken and the Beef Pad Lard Na.  The chicken dish was good, tasted like an orange chicken, deep fried until crispy then tossed in a sweet tangerine sauce.  It had a few strips of red bell pepper also.  The beef dish I liked a little more, it was the wide egg noodles and had chunks of beef, onion, pea pods and bok choy in a really good brown sauce.  You can order many of the dishes mild to HOT, so I did a medium hot since I sharing the dishes I didn't want to blow them out of the water with too spicy of a dish.  Next time I will definitely go hotter!  The dishes came with 2 containers of sticky white rice, which was exactly what it sounds like. I didn't have any dessert, but the crispy bananas sound great, and I am interested in trying the ice creams I keep hearing about.  I also really want to try the soups, they sound good.    All in all, it was good (I keep saying good!)  the prices are reasonable, and the portions are big.  I have enough for lunch leftovers today.  So, it is worth giving them a try, and I will be back."
Food is still excellent! Service is still Meh! Prices and portions are still a disappointment!
"Pretty good, food,, about the same as other vietnamese food I've had before. The place its self is really nice. Stands out in a pretty old and gritty neighborhood. Got a bowl with spring rolls with chicken and beef. By the end i was full and just for $10."
"Delicious. Offcourse fruity but its about the experience of a complete flavour. Served with good vibes, Gracias."
"Very slow and incompetent staff. Food is okay, nothing special. I would definitely avoid this place next time I'm in Vegas."
"Good food and nice clean place ... I ate the ""buffalo soldier"" there and took a ""sweet home alabama"" home ... yum"
"I was really disappointed with my most recent visit to Vintage 95. I make it out there every six months or so and always talk it up to friends. Tonight I went with my husband and in-laws. We ordered a carafe of sangria, which as always was top notch. My in-laws ordered bruschetta - they ended up with a ton of untoasted bread with a very thin coat of ricotta and a light topping of good quality tomatoes. Tasty but not bruschetta and definitely not worth $14. My husband and I got the ""artisan board"" with one meat and one cheese. For $13, we got a teeny tiny piece of cheese, four thin slices of not-so-good sopressata, stale bread, 2 crackers, raw unsalted almonds, six grapes, and about half a jar of very oniony cornichons! The food was a huge rip-off, and not at all the quality or quantity we have gotten in the past. The saving grace of the night was the sangria, which I still think is one of the best in the area. But overall, I don't think this place is worth a trip out anymore."
"We ate there yesterday for the first time. My husband ordered fish tacos and I had the five shrimp with sticky rice. He loved his dish. The fish had a nice, slightly spicy sauce on them. It was Mahi Mahi. The shredded veggies were also just perfect. He said he would order it again. I also liked the dish I had. The asparagus was delightful. The rice section was very bland, but our waitress brought some soy sauce for me. This improved everything. I would just ask for soy sauce when ordering this dish again. I would order it again. We also shared a small dessert in a glass. It was boston cream pie. Very tasty. I was happy they had the nice, little desserts. Anything else would have been too much. It was perfect. We will definitely go back. The prices were very reasonable."
"Great ambiance, great food, although their policy of no reservations can be a drag. Great place for ribs...they are so tender they fall off the bone. I always order the Louisiana chicken.....a flattened chicken breast smothered with grilled vegetables and goat cheese. Goat cheese is like bacon...it just makes everything better. Also try their artichoke dip as an appetizer...it is the best out there. On our last visit ( less than a week ago) ,their baked beans were different...hopefully it was just a hiccup because they are usually incredible. Service is always excellent and the prices are reasonable considering portion size."
"Not bad at all.  The standard dishes - chinese broccoli, xiu mai, ha cao, chicken feet, black bean pork ribs, steamed bbq pork bun, shrimp wrapped in thick rice noodle, chinese donut wrapped in rice noodle - were all a-ok.  The rice and chicken served in a vertical bamboo cup was tasty; flavors were similar to Vietnamese 'com ga', with ginger, light soy, and chicken.  The xiu mai had orange/yellow 'eggs' on it which tasted like crab innards/tomal/mustard; rich and super flavorful.  All the dumplings were packed with meat and/or seafood and not a lot of fillers (yay!).  The only downside is that the offerings are limited/uninspired; just the basics.  I'd come back if I were in LV and craving dim sum.  Other important info: small establishment, push cart servers, prices are higher than CA but definitely reasonable, located inside Gold Coast Hotel off the Strip next to RIo and across from the Palms."
"I ordered the Heart Shaped pizza and meatball sliders on V-day and it really hit the spot. My honey and I both had to work but wanted something easy that maintains the V-day spirit. Why not a heart shaped pizza? They had a special of a large heart shape with an extra topping for about $20 with tax. Pretty good deal! If you don't already know, Metro pizza serves up a pretty yum pie. I am familiar with a few of their locations, and this one did not taint the reputation.  My favorite thing from Metro however, is not the pizza. It is their meatball sliders with fries. BOMB! Yummy meatball sheltered in a garlic knot, YAS PLEASE! They are soooo good! The fries is really good too. Only complaint, fries portion shrinks every time we order the sliders. Please don't skimp on the fries! My experience with Metro is solely based on take out. I need to plan a time to dine-in."
"I knew coming here, there would be a long line. We waited about 25 mins which isn't too bad. There is a menu displayed around the corner so it is nice to look at what you want to order before you get to the cashier.  We got the infamous ""slut,"" Fairfax sandwich and some orange juice. The orange juice taste so good! So refreshing and taste fresh squeeze! The Slut is pretty good, its eggs and mash potatoes with bread to dip. The sandwiches are amazing and the Fairfax doesn't disappoint. I still think of the bread and how soft it is!   Just give it a try, you won't be disappointed."
They have good chicken and bomb biscuits when fresh. I just hate the service and paying for sauce. I mean I just bought a 12 pc bucket can I have atleast one sauce? I understand if I didn't buy chicken but whatever lol end rant.
"Just pulled up about 20 minutes ago and no one was at the drive-thru, pulled up again because they appeared after we were gone. Took them about 5 minutes to take our order. In addition, she was giving attitude because we said hello due to bad audio coming through. I only gave 1 star because we actually got our food. Very irritated and disappointed."
"Been a while since we came here but loved it.  Little bit loud but ok and maybe not as fancy as some of its other locations (Chicago, Miami), but:  - food was same and awesome.   - loved the Wygu Beef Gyoza, couple rolls we had, salad, drinks, etc.  Great menu right now they have to choose from.  Seems the same in all cities for the moment."
Food was good but  took forever. It seemed like they needed more help. 20 minutes for not being that busy.  Hopefully next visit is better.
"Excellent coffee cake, like to die for!! Tortilla soup was a major hit! Great experience for first day in Vegas!"
"Read the reviews and thought I would try it. Yelpers were on point with this one. Good Asian fare, reasonably priced and nice portions. Food was very fresh tasting and seasoning not overpowering. I will definitely come back. Service was great also. This is a hidden gem in the Hard Rock!"
"We have been trying Eggplant sandwiches all over the valley because my day loves eggplant.  Delfaco's sandwich on the Italian Hoagie had way way too much bread more bread than eggplant.  The eggplant by itself was very tasty, but get it without so much bread, you will thank me later.  We will be back to try something else.  I went at 11 am on a Saturday morning and still waited over 30 minutes for a take out order.  It is a very crammed space, a little Italian deli in between a Italian grocery store.  The prices for the Italian pastas and cheese are a bit over priced.  The espresso is nicely priced at $1.40 for a single shot."
"I read some good reviews on this place and decided to give it a try . I was not disappointed ! My son and I really liked the Chicken Fried Steak . You could tell it was handmade with cube steak and not a frozen patty . The cinnamon roll was also homemade with good icing , not too sweat like cinnabon . They also have preserves that are made by the owner , and the raspberry is out of this world . I bought a small mason jar to take home . The biscuits were fluffy , grits cooked just right , and eggs cooked perfectly could have used another one . We will be coming back and looking forward to trying other things . You have to be careful driving here because you will easily pass it as I did , and had to drive back around the block . I recommend you come and the server was very nice ."
"All you need to know is DRIED AND BLAND. My burrito tasted like cardboard. If you've placed cardboard in your mouth, you know what I mean. Texture was similar too.   Oh and they forgot my order. I stood there for 10 mins then someone realized I didn't have my order."
"OMG, Longhitano's is absolutely disgusting! I've had more satisfactory meals from Arby's than this over hyped pos. Our server was polite but a bit...ditsy & didn't understand the questions we asked or reply with the correct response. I ordered their Alfredo- it smelled & looked terrible upon arrival but I forced myself to at least try it. Huge mistake! When I stabbed it with my fork it was one big massive clump that tasted like it was held together with elmers glue & watered down flour. Although it was luke warm @ best on the surface, it was cold underneath. Even the poor attempt @ garlic bread was laughable. Someone smeared butter on toast & sprinkled too much  garlic salt on it. It's pretty damn bad when Olive Garden's food is more tolerable than this inedible crap.   Our friend ordered their The Biggest Haja Steak Sandwich, this should've been called ""The Biggest Hard Turd Sandwich"" if they wanted to provide a more accurate description. When he bit into it, he literally could not tear one piece off because it was so tough & rubbery. He tried  sawing at it & the knife didn't even make a dent. When Mike stopped to ask us how everything was, Nate expressed how terrible the meat on the sandwich was @ Mike stood their as if he didn't comprehend a word that was said to him. In fact, he kept cutting Nate off & saying "" So it's okay"". Naturally, Nate was irritated & said "" NO! I can't eat this"" & Mike still didn't get it & kept talking over him. Then he walked away...he never apologized nor offered to get Nate something else to eat. He didn't remove the cost from our bill, nothing! When Nate complained to our server he didn't understand either so the nasty sandwich sat there. Our server also saw that my pasta was left untouched but never asked if something was wrong. I get this kid was clearly new to the food service industry but seriously -WTF!?!    My husband had also ordered a drink from the bar when we first sat down, it took our server over 15 minutes to grab it from the bar. Nate had requested a rootbeer, not only did it take over 30 minutes but our server brought out a rootbeer float & charged us extra for the ice cream! Normally I wouldn't suggest this but since the staff was ignoring our complaints, the food wasn't even edible & our patience was gone; I was tempted to leave without paying.   Finally, a seasoned waitress noticed our displeasure & offered to remove Nates sandwich from our receipt. However, she only took 15% off of my alfredo & removed the charge for ice cream but charged us for 2 rootbeers when we only ordered 1. She then explained that all of their staff quit @ the same time & all the new hires are ""green"". This is still unacceptable & I don't feel that anyone there is competent. Longhitano's is hands down the second worst meal I've had this year!"
"Yum! Wasn't expecting this to be as good or as nice atmosphere wise. With a name like nando's was comparing it to filly bees, much better! Homemade chips and salsa. As a vegetarian I seriously appreciate the ability to order tacos, burrito, or chimichangas with veggies or potatoes! Plus you can't beat pitchers of Dos Equis! I took off a star because their guacamole tastes like it comes from a package. This place gets enough business to use real guacamole. Worth a taste if you're in the area!"
Fu ck everything in the past...this place is bomb OMG tacos burgers tortas I'm typing with fill belly!!! #FunTacosLV
"Omg this place is amazing! The food was phenomenal, but our server Christina was by far the best part of the meal! She was so outgoing, funny, attentive, and well informed on the menu. Will definitely be back for the food and Christina."
"Found this place on Yelp and we couldn't have agreed more with the reviews. This is a tiny hole in the wall next to an asian massage ""R&T"". I could have driven by this place hundreds of times and never seen it. Ignore the tacky decor, because this place has some of the best carne asada in Phoenix. Start with the chips and salsa and you will see that this isn't your regular taco shop.   We tried the carne asada tacos, carne asada burrito and the chips and guacamole. All delicious. The carne asada is tender and full of flavor. Guacamole and salsas are so fresh and tasty that you will run thru your chips in no time.   We have been to Sonora Grill now a few times and I am just getting around to my review. I think that says it all. Sonora Grill is a must!"
"This is a very fun restaurant with amazing food. I go to the other location just about every day and wanted to give this one a try so I did and was very pleased. It feels like a different restaurant because of the size but it's the same great food and same fun vibe. The staff is great and I will definitely be coming back on the regular to see them.  Come in twice a week till you've tried the entire menu,  i promise you'll be glad you did."
"best fajita in town in my opinion! we have been there twice, and the only thing we ordered was fajita for two with beef only. it was always awesome and delicious. staff was courteous there, and the price was reasonable. We aren't gonna go anywhere else for fajita from now on xD."
"I recently moved to AZ and this was my first Saturday night coming to Hooters.  I came right after getting off of work to grab some wings and a beer before heading home for the evening.  I just wanted to say the staff was extremely friendly and fun.  I definitely enjoyed my visit and will be coming back.  Brandi, tending bar, was great to talk to; quick witted and funny.  Food was great, on time and delicious, even though when I walked in, there was a UFC fight going on and the place was packed.  Their ability to get food and drinks out with a full house was refreshing.  I was skeptical at first but they nailed it.  I would recommend this location to anyone."
Server was slow but you're at the airport food was decent ! But something happened after wth the server that was not very pleasant ...soooooo they only get 3 stars lol
"I have been fortune to spend around 20 weekends at the Venetian including the first weekend they opened.  It has always been and still is a class hotel.  It has worn well and looks as good it did that first weekend.  The rooms are all suites and some are bigger then others but even in the smallest suite is larger then most hotels junior suite.  You know this hotel got it's act together when there version of a coffee shop is the Grand Lux Cafe , which is a off shoot of The Cheesecake Factory.  They have great restaurants and shows.  The poker room is one of the best.  See you soon old friend."
"Okay, I know this is supposed to be the ""cheap"" restaurant in the Wynn, but we're still talking about $18 burgers for lunch, so cheap is relative.  We waited 35 minutes for our food, and of course they got our order wrong.  Did I mention that the place is like half full.  Good thing it wasn't busier, then we might wait an hour for the wrong order.  They of course add 18% for parties of 6 or more so great!  I get to way overpay for the wrong food.  I got lazy and didn't want to leave the resort.  Bad call there."
Wow! This this is the best burger in town. And I've had a lot of burgers! Service was friendly and fast!
"I have been here countless times and keep coming back. All of my friends are hooked too. Delicious salads, bowls, burgers, wraps, and desserts--all vegan! Best items include black bean burrito, buddha bowl, ace of kales salad, quinoa onion rings, sweet potato fries, and the vanilla cupcake. Always busy but totally worth it."
"I've had the pleasure of dining at the other locations of Yardbird so I was pretty excited to be able to try out their new Vegas location.   I like it, although it definitely departs from the Southern draw of the other location and that authentic kitchen to table feel. We got the usual deviled eggs, chicken and waffles, and cobbler to finish. Overall the chicken was not as great as the Miami location and the cobbler was a bit disappointing. However, the eggs were delicious and waffles were on point!  I will say it's a pretty solid lunch spot so definitely pay a visit when you have a chance."
"Soooo delicious! With all the burger joints in town, this one is in my top three favorites now! We ate spicy burger and dog, the burger was juicy and flavorful, the dog spicy and different. It is worth the 30 minute trip for us to get there. A cute little place with games, great service and is clean."
"I want this place to do well, because it would be great to have a fancy Mexican option in town. I think they could make this into a pretty solid little restaurant if they fix some problems. The drinks are tasty, but very very heavy on the ice. They are charging drink prices comparable to Boltini down the street, which actually gives you a full glass instead of all this padding. We felt a bit ripped off. I also wish that the specialty cocktail selection had some not-sweet cocktails. One of us got a taco plate and the other got a torta plate. On both, the sides left a lot to be desired. I'm pretty sure our beans and rice were out of a can, and the potato wedges were fresh out of the freezer... The tacos themselves (1 shrimp, 1 fish) were pretty good, though! Only complaint is that they didn't double up on the tortillas, so one of mine fell apart a bit. The steak torta was pretty good, although it would have done well with some pickled chiles.  I am somewhat annoyed that they don't provide free chips with dinner. The entree size isn't that big, which would have been fine if we got chips, but we left feeling hungry. Another rather big oversight is not providing some sort of spicy table salsa. The food wasn't very spicy in itself. Any good Mexican restaurant should have some house salsas.  I think the main problem here is cutting corners in really obvious ways: drinks loaded to brim with ice, no chips, no table salsa, sides are low quality afterthoughts. Even the lack of the doubled up tortilla. Come on guys, tortillas are not expensive. You can afford to give me 4 instead of 2 with my $8 entree.  Another weird thing that was noted by all my dining companions: Pretty much every Mexican joint in the town has Mexican people working the back AND the front of the house, including several restaurants owned by this very same family. Here, the front of house waitstaff is exclusively white skinny blond ladies. That has to be a conscious decision.  I can't help but throw at least some side eye at an establishment that decided that actual Mexican people aren't ""classy"" enough to wait tables."
"Let me start by saying I wish that I could give 1/2 stars. I would rate 3 1/2 vs 3. Really better than ok but I'm not sure that it rates 4 stars. It was a good restaurant but had some pretty big negatives.   The first thing that I notice was how large the restaurant was. It seemed to go on forever. Which was amazing considering how quickly our food came out. They have an open kitchen so you can see how many people they have working in the kitchen. Needless to say it's busy.   One drawback as others have mentioned is the noise level. Fortunately my husband and I were sitting by drapery panels so the 2 of us could carry on a conversation. Others sitting more towards the inside of the restaurant would have a difficult time hearing each other. Another issue is that it is pretty dark. I understand ambiance but this was a little too much. They know this so they do compensate and make the print larger on the menu. When it came to eating and my food was the same color (fish and cauliflower) it was hard to tell exactly what I was putting on the fork.  Our server was very good. Attentive and full of information when clarification was needed for the menu. We had Avocado bruschetta which was just okay. I should of skipped it. I ordered the Pacific Sea Bass. The fish was good and so was the cauliflower. They only thing I didn't care for was the preserved grapefruit. The funny thing is that while eating it I said to my husband that I didn't like the orange flavor that I was sometimes getting on the fish. It was either orange or when they preserve it then it totally changes the taste profile from grapefruit to orange. My husband had the lasagna bolognese. He was happy with his choice.  Overall, a good restaurant. I took off since it was extremely dark and loud. Also, the food comes out almost too quick if you just want to sit and talk. The food was good, especially for the price, not excellent."
"Was absolutely starving we passed this place and decided to give it a try. Prices are decent, fries are fresh cut and amazing, burger was fresh and flavorful.  I would get take our next time because the place was freezing imnot sure they had heat on, not the most enjoyable eating lunch with a jacket scarf and hat on"
"What a Shock!  Had Philly Cheese Steaks coast to coast including Philly.  In 55 years of enjoying sandwiches;  This Gilbert Geno's has the distintion of being one of the worst sandwiches I have had.  I got a large on an OK bread with a small serving mix of goo that reminded me of Manwich out of a can.  Or Cincinnati Chili.   Either way, putting the Geno's name on it would make Joey Vento roll in his grave"
"I was not a fan of this location or the staff.  The food was sub par, the service was lacking, and overall it was not a good experience.  For the amount of $$ per dish I expect it to be prepared better"
"I was staying across the street at the Wynn and my post-Disneyland Half Marathon legs weren't really up for a lot of walking, so I suggested we check out TI for dinner. I think the buffet at Treasure Island used to be called Dishes or something and I remembered it being pretty good. Unfortunately, ""The Buffet"" as it's now known has declined quite a bit in quality.  First, all of the meats are pre-sliced which is crazy. The slices of prime rib were totally dried out and starting to turn grey. The turkey fared a little better, but gravy rescues pretty much everything although either the turkey or gravy was very salty. Speaking of salty, I was curious to try the pho which was, you guessed it, super salty. There is no salad bar here and instead you can get various salads made that looked really good - too bad no one was manning the counter. And finally, the most ridiculous thing of all was the pre-scooped ice cream in dishes which had melted into a soup. On the plus side, the crab legs weren't bad and I enjoyed the mini donuts and chocolate covered strawberries.  I hope this buffet gets their act together soon. Sightly unrelated, but this was my first time at TI in a long time and I couldn't stand the smell of the casino! They pump some weird coconut sunblock smell all over the place which is way worse than stale cigarette air. Yuck"
Had the lemon grass chicken. It was amazing. The ambience is great ! I highly recommend this if your looking for good Vietnamese
"A solid 3.5, based on the Chicken Sandwich  I cannot speak about the pizza or pasta, but this sandwich shop is in a really convenient location for me.  I stopped in 'cause I was pressed for time, had to grab a quick dinner, & didn't want Subway/McD's in the plaza.  I asked the girl taking the orders about which was better, either the Panzarotti OR 1 of the sanwiches.  She answered sandwiches and suggested the Chicken.  Chicken was in a schnitzel format, flattened, breaded, & deep fried - actually quite similar to a veal sandwich!  Only 1 size of sandwich here and they were quite substantial, cut in half in which I only ate half for dinner, all for $7.  Cheaper than On-A-Bun.  A slew of toppings (cheese, mushrooms, peppers, etc.) were ALL included for an additional $1.  Not bad if you feel as though you need these additional things.  Hot green peppers were added as I wanted it spicy.  Very good, especially when it's eaten fresh!  No nonsense sandwich place, hopefully healthier than McD's??  ;)"
"Pretty stinky service today. Although the food is usually good bar food, we didn't get to place our order today.  No less than 5 servers passed our table while we waited to place our order. Maybe we just caught them in the middle of a shift change. Ended up leaving, but not too upset as we went to Taste of Buffalo where their wing are just better."
This was soooo good ! The fish was delicious. Make sure you give them your total rewards card for more points. Everything taste really good. If you're Platinum and up you're drinks are included (alcoholic) but you might as well grab drinks off the casino floor  The ice cream is made in house it's NOT soft serve. There are comfortable booths and tv screens in there. The bathrooms are located OUTSIDE. Ask for directions. It was good. For the 3 of us it was $81 just to give you an idea  I was too busy stuffing my face to take photos. Sorry !
"Honestly I just don't get the how everyone is so in love with this place?  I'm not a native so when I moved to the area many years ago everyone advised my family that we absolutely had to try a burnt almond torte from Prantl's.  We did, and to be fair that is a great dessert.  However, I have worked across the street from them for a decade now, and the office ladies I work with have brought in nearly everything they sell at Prantl's over the last decade.  The cookies, the cupcakes, the junior pastries, danishes, donuts, etc... have all made there way into our office, and I have never been wowed by any of them.  In fact I find most items to be pretty sub par.  I think if Prantl's wasn't a true bakery and merely a shop that produced one signature cake it would probably deserve five stars, but that's not the case, and since I have to judge on the totality of their products as a bakery, not only the burnt almond torte which is their claim to fame and recognition, I find them to be quite lackluster overall.  If you want a true bakery treat I would suggest  La Gourmandine for anything, Vanilla for cupcakes, Jean Marc Chatellier, even the somewhat overrated Oakmont Bakery, as other than the burnt almond torte, you are paying specialty bakery prices but getting Giant Eagle quality, which is fine, but at that point you might as well go to Giant Eagle and pay accordingly."
"I had lunch at the buffet and it was by far the best buffet I've had in Vegas to date (I've travelled here quite often). The choices at lunch time are a bit overwhelming as they had full breakfast choices with omlette station, sushi bar, meat carving station, pastas, deserts, and the list goes on and on. My only dissappointment was that I could not eat more.  Best $20 buffet/variety you can have on the Strip."
"This place is so awesome! The food is so good, I haven't had crepes this good in years! People are friendly and they have a good barista along with a ton of different drinks. Only down side is they are only open until 2 :("
"We were looking for Lancasters and ended up here.. which was good bc the food was pretty good!   I had the philly with onion and mushroom and white american cheese and the homemade chips and it was all delicious. The sandwich had a lot of flavor without being really greasy (as cheesesteaks often are) and the chips were a good mix of crispy and soft that I expect when I'm getting homemade chips.   Other dishes at the table - chicken club sandwich (reportedly VERY good) and a cheeseburger (reported as Ok, but he ate it all so it couldnt have been too bad!!)  Note: They had the BEST Sweet tea I've had in a few years. Really super delish. I'd definetely go back here."
"The last time I gave this place a try, the food sucked and I gave it 2 Stars.  On a recent Vegas trip my flight was at a gate nearby and I decided to give them another chance.    This time around, the food still sucked, but the employees are even worse.  Here's what happened....I ordered the following items:  Bean, Rice, Cheese Burrito $6.99 Bottle of Diet Pepsi $3.19  Since I had a backpack and other stuff in my hand, I forgot the bottle of Diet Pepsi at the counter after I paid for the meal.  I went to the counter to get settled in a spot to eat and get napkins, utensils, etc.  5 minutes later, they called my number for my Burrito....I was starving, so I started to eat it.  After a few bites, I noticed that I didn't have my soda....where was it?  I looked around, went back to the counter.....the employees looked at me but didn't say anything.  I walked around again looking for it....then I said to the girl cashier ""I think I left my Soda somewhere, have you seen it?""  She said ""No"" then looked at one of the guys and said something in Spanish to him.  He said, ""Oh, I think I have it.  I found it on the counter"".  I watched as he reached into his backpack and gave it back to me.....WTF?!  I think they do this all the time, watch for people to leave stuff behind and then take it.  The appalling thing is that I was still in the restaurant!    I didn't say anything to them...it would've done no good anyway.  Once a thief, always a thief.  That does it for me, I will never eat here again.  Return Factor - 0%"
"Came here for brunch with friends for the Downtown Tempe Brunch Crawl, and it was very crowded. I don't think the food was anything too special.  SERVICE: SLOW. In their defense the place was pretty packed but all the dishes came out at separate times :(   AMBIENCE: indoor and outdoor seating though be careful with outdoors because it is HOT in the summer and very few shaded areas   FOOD: for the brunch crawl there were $3 bloody Mary's, $3 bloody Maria's, and $3 breakfast tacos. We got an assortment. The food was good but nothing huge to write home over and the tacos were tasty but nothing too special."
"This shop combines coffee, breakfast and coffee break items and a yarn shop (which made my wife happy). During a recent visit we enjoyed well made asparagus and ham quiches with well dressed side greens. There were three regular and one decaf offerings from two area roasters. Service was friendly and helpful."
"They had great food try the SantaFe Skillet delicious. But they have a tremendous waiter, named David. This gentleman belongs in a 5 Star restaurant with out a doubt, he made the evening for me and my family. The night shift, wow what service. Just go one time you will walk out with a smile, Dennys is really lucky to have this guy:) Wgag a great pleasure, thank you David!!"
"... and having been back again a few days ago, I will leave my rating as 3-stars. The service was faster this time and the food was okay, but I really don't find anything special about it. I had a bowl of the Witch's Brew chowder which was pretty good, and the coleslaw that I missed the first time. Overall, I would say that the food is on par with other places that I have had fish and chips, although a little more expensive than some. I might return if in the area, but wouldn't travel across town just to go back."
"I have been here way too many times, and we are over it.  I will say prices are good on both food and drinks, but you get what you pay for.  On two occasions we had large parties (15+) who all are and drank a lot, and we had horrible service.  They acted like w were a bother, when actually we probably spent close to $800 that night in total.  Very disappointing.  We will not be back."
"Ended up there for beer week. Atmosphere is great although pretty loud. Had the calamari, octopus, and wings appetizers. First two were really good bites though small portions. Wings were spicy but not special. Looking forward to them opening up the butcher shop."
"Boarder grill has pretty good food, but I've had just ok meals there too. Considering the prices I'd expect every meal to be exceptional but I haven't been blown away every time. It's a special place for the wife and I so we do enjoy going. The drinks are pretty amazing and I leave stuffed every time. I suggest anything with steak in it and you can't go wrong. Not a fan of red meat? Go for the carnitas."
"I was still too full from lunch at The Coffee Cup in Boulder City to eat a whole dinner. I had the white sangria, excellent. Also the salad with the Asian pear and blue cheese crumbles. The dressing was mango, and delicious. But the best part were the desserts. We had the pineapple upside down cake w. coconut ice cream, and the chocolate molten cake, with raspberry coulis and vanilla ice cream. WOW! Both were just awesome. We don't have anything comparable to the pineapple upside down cake in Boston, it was fantastic. Service was excellent!"
Not so good. Extremely slow service.  Chicken not very tasty. Instant mashed potatoes. Gravy no flavor.  As we were eating there were 15 people waiting in line for service.  Pretty expensive for what you get.  We wont be back.
"This place gives buffets a good name. The food is always fresh and interesting. The breakfast and brunch are possibly the best in Las Vegas. The Friday and Saturday night gourmet dinner buffet, is unreal. Try Beef Wellington, Venison and Steak Tartar just to name a few."
"Great spot for a quick coffee, latte, cap, and of course Japanese style cold brew. Good selection of pastries and snacks. Right in the heart of downtown PHX, they even have a lovely patio to enjoy your morning starter."
"Got here around 1:45, waited in line for about 15, not bad.  Bad happens now.  The placed jam packed and I cannot locate my friends for over half an hour.  They were playing pretty good music, too bad I couldn't enjoy myself because I was on a mission to find my friends.  I find my friends, one of them is drunk, super drunk.  Within five minutes of meeting them, one of them pukes and next thing I know is we are being forced to leave.  Did I mention I had to pay $30 + service fee to get in????  But that was just my luck, I can't blame the venue for things like this.  Would have been better if they granted re-entry upon the rest of us returning to the pool - no. Sure there are rules and one of them happens to be no re-entry, but absolutely no flexibility?  Especially at a place where bouncers ask for $200 to bribe them (yes, this apparently happened earlier in the day to my friends).  It's a nightmare trying to take care of a drunk person and get the belongings (one coat check, meaning we had to take other people's belongings too).  You are not allowed in the hotel unless you have your bottoms on (reason why we had to get everyone's stuff).  I was handed the room key and room number via text because we thought it would be easier to get back in (although chances were very slim) as opposed to two.  The security calls for paramedics and they come to do their simple check up.  I was pissed and annoyed but they were doing their job so no complaints from a sober person point of view so that was okay.  We got the okay to go and I took the friend up to the room.  I get back to the Beach Club and explained I had my other friends' stuff AND the room key without which they will not be able to get back into the hotel.  I cannot reach the other friend with a phone.  Shoot, I'm thinking I'm not coming to Vegas again.  One of the security people approached me and asked how my friend was, HOW WONDERFUL HE ASKED! Because I also explained to him my current situation and he talked to the other people at the door and they let me in. See?  There is the reasonable flexibility.  (hence, two stars, not one)  So here is my real experience at Encore Beach Club:  There is just too many people.  You are just standing in water jumping up and down OR doing the same thing outside the pool.  It is too packed.  Getting drinks at the bar is unimaginable - the line is just insane.  With that many drunk people still drinking, who knows how much pee is present in the water???  The lifeguards are annoying as hell, blowing the whistles for every single thing - no splashing, etc.  They all go insanely crazy when a guy gets on the stripper pole area even for a second, I thought an arrest was about to be made with so many whistles going off.  If you have no issues dropping the dough you could spend purchasing a very decent DSLR, go for the tables and cabanas with wait service.  Otherwise, not worth the entrance fee.  By entering here though you have a full excuse to be at the douchiest level possible for guys or to act as if you have no brain for girls so if that's what you want (seemed like that's what everyone else wanted at this place), go here without the $$$$$.  Standard party goers in Vegas but this place by far the worst.  Lock box is available for $20 by the entrance.  Not going back."
Awesome place. Clubhouse salad is my favorite. Only place that I know of where the chicken is warm. What a nice touch. Nice size serving. Like that they put a pitcher of iced tea on the table. Keep up the great work!
One word:  Amazing!!  Real southern food - will NOT disappoint.  And I know southern!  Chef Austin took great care of our group for my Bday celebration in Vegas. Not easy to please everyone at a large table of picky eaters looking for a taste of home!  Fried chicken was perfection - seasoned so well!  Can't wait to return.
"Horrible service. They took the orders of people who came in after me.  Then they served people who ordered after me.  I felt like they ignored me because I was on my own. I waited for over 30 minuted then they said the kitchen messed up.  If you are going to keep your customers happy , hire more staff that know what they are doing."
"Average food and service. Kind of dirty and some flies going around. Was ignored by two staff members when I walked up to ask a question. Plastic cups, bowls, and chopsticks."
Great BBQ!!!  Truly like that I grew up on in Alabama and Georgia!  The variety and quality of the sides add to the experience all the more.  I just wish they had the amazing peach cobbler everytime I visit!  It's as close to Grandma's as your going to get!  :-)
"We were there in the morning on a Saturday, the line for the place stretched around it and back to the elevators. Clearly 45 minutes. This is sort of a fast food situation, not a sit down restaurant, and by that I mean you buy the food and fight for a place to eat at a very few seating options. I'm sure the food is good based on these reviews, but don't make a special trip to go here if you are in the area, like we did. We ended up going somewhere else. No eggsluttiness for us, unfortunately."
We went because of the high recommendations. I wish we would have walked out as soon as we saw the tacky decor. Each meal is large enough to feed an entire family if that family wants a low quality meal. They definitively stress quantity over quality.  I suggest passing on this one.
"We just returned here for our second visit on New Year's Eve (our first visit was a NYE a few years back), and I'm just as in love with the place as I was before.  Sure, it's a splurge (which is why we only end up here on New Year's Eve), but it's a worthy splurge.  This NYE, they had a prix fixe menu, in addition to a smaller-than-normal regular menu, but since we are samplers, we decided to each get the 5-course prix fixe so we could try as many things as possible.  I love that a trip to Sonoma Grille is not just dinner, it's an entire event.  Our waitress, Barb, was fantastic - knowledgeable about the menu, and passionate about it too.  They had just introduced some new items, so the servers had recently done their menu taste-test, and to hear her describe everything was like being there in the room as each dish was sampled and explained.  Sonoma Grille is regularly recognized as having one of the best wine selections in the city, and it's true.  The markup is a bit much, but again, you're paying for atmosphere and experience in addition to good California wines (I'd love to see a bit more Central Coast, as that's my favorite wine region, but the name is 'Sonoma,' so I give them a pass).  The staff can answer any question you have about the wine, which I really appreciate.  We started with the 'Trio of Amuse' appetizer, which had a parsnip bisque (light and flavorful), some oysters (which weird me out a bit, I must admit), and a teeny tiny beef carpaccio that was perfect in every way.  It was just one little nibble, but it was an insane burst of flavor.  While we were enjoying our wine and appetizer, the bread server came around with a selection of four different kinds of bread.  Instead of an individual table serving being brought to your table, a server comes with a large basket and serves you a few pieces of your choosing, plus olive oil for dipping.  I don't know why, but I love this little unique aspect of this restaurant.  For the larger appetizer (oh yes, two appetizers), we each got the jumbo lump crab and avocado plate.  This was gigantic - we could have easily split one between the two of us.  The crab pieces were huge, easily the size of garlic bulbs.  My only suggestion for this would be to have a few pieces of the crostini instead of just a little sliver at the bottom.  The actual plate was quite juicy, and the crunch of the crostini was a good balance.  Mmm, this was like crab guacamole, so in other words, amazing.  My husband and I each got different salads.  He opted for the fois gras salad (which he loved, even though I was a bit too squeamish to sample it), and I got what I shall refer to as the pile 'o beets.  Anyone who knows me knows my love affair with beets, and this was just perfect.  Slices of beets interspersed with goat cheese and well-seasoned... wish I could eat that every day.  Not very 'salad-y' but heavenly nonetheless.  There were five different options for entrees, but we both had our eye on only one thing: the filet mignon.  Oh. My. Word.  This steak was cooked to perfection - so tender and juicy that my mouth is watering just remembering it!  It came with garlicky whipped potatoes and broccolini (which I delicately pushed to the side - sorry broccoli, we're never going to be friends).  The portion was huge, and I had the second half wrapped up for lunch the next day.  We were nearly too full for dessert, but had to make room to try the chocolate ravioli.  It's a little weird, and the texture is a bit chewier than I would have thought, but the flavor was excellent.  It came with a nice blend of raspberry and vanilla sauce for dipping, and was perfect alongside a steaming cup of coffee.  All in all, we had another excellent experience.  Barb even offered to keep my leftovers in the fridge until after the midnight festivities, but I was afraid I'd forget in the massive crowd leaving downtown, so we walked it back to the car anyway.  I was not going to let myself miss out on a second meal of that filet in the aftermath of Pittsburgh fireworks lol.  This is one NYE tradition we plan on keeping for many years to come!"
"By far the best Mexican food we have had in Las Vegas. The fideo soup was loaded with flavor and so we're the salsas. We ordered the lunch combinations so we could try a variety and we were not disappointed by any of them. The service was impeccable, we will definitely be back soon."
"Pretty unique place! The food was awesome, and I met O.J. Simpson in the order line! Haha! True story...."
"First, the good things.  The Chili Chicken is awesome.  My wife and I both love it as it is spiced well and different than what we have had at other restaurants.  The Nan was also fluffy and not greasy. The Peas Palau was also unique with fruit and nuts.   Now the challenges.  I have been here several times and although they say Dosa on the online  menu and also on some signs in the restaurant, I have yet to be there when they can actually serve it. The beans in the Chana Masala were undercooked both times we ordered it.  They also don't make Dall.  What Indian restaurant doesn't make Dal?  Still too early to give them 2 stars but hope they get consistent on what they can serve."
"Honestly, you can't go wrong. The quality is consistent across all the chains and reliable to whatever you may be used to.  I do have one tip to customers. I made an online order with the steak meat on the side. NEVER ORDER THE MEAT ON THE SIDE.  I'm pregnant so I can't have raw meat, but I love chipotle. I didn't want to be a pain so I figured I'd just order it on the side and cook it to well done at home.  I only got a TINY little plastic tub of meat...I asked the lady at the register,""this is the meat on the side??"" She almost looked ashamed and said,""uhh, yea..""  *there's a photo reference.  Needless to say, I'm sure once I can eat undercooked meat again I'm sure I'll be back. Just sorta sucked because you pay so much for their food, you'd think they'd have larger containers nearby. Plus I know this is a special request.  Oh well...lesson learned."
"This restaurant was really good & we all had a wonderful dining experience with our large group. Excellent & attentive service, fresh & flavorful ingredients, nice plating of entrees, and walked out of there full & happy. Would definitely go back again."
"My kids took me here for my birthday dinner.   I had the gigantic pork chop and generous helpings of mashed potatoes and rice. Yes, I know that's a LOT of starch but one of them was a substitute for -- I think -- Brussel sprouts, which I do NOT eat.  But it was DELICIOUS.  I had been craving a pork chop for months.   Thanks Harevey's for a great night."
"I've been to many of the Day Clubs in Vegas. Hands down, Encore Beach Club aka EBC is one of the best day clubs you can go to. One of the MAIN reasons why this is one of the best is that they actually have Gaming Tables. Most Day Clubs don't (actually, I don't think any other day clubs have gaming tables, with the exception of XS but that is a nightclub). So if you're a gambler like me, you're gonna want to go here. Also, If you're going to book a table, I recommend booking the Lilypads. Why? Its on the water so you can chill on your Lilypad and hang out in the water. Best of both worlds in my opinion! You can't order food from your Lilypad but you can order food from the grill and BRING it to your lilypad. So you're good! If you're going to book any tables at EBC, make sure you go through a reputable promoter. I HIGHLY recommend booking with the EBC VIP host Brian Pfeiffer (773) 459-8133 - His cell phone. Just text him! He is AMAZZZINNNGG. He will walk you in, he will make sure you're all good and he will answer all your questions. Just went to Vegas this past weekend and had a blast."
The food was good but not for the price we paid. It's good for a gas station as well. The corn was under cooked for sure. I did like the BBQ beans a lot. I do feel for the amount you spend it should knock your socks off or taste like you cooked it at home. I do it a 3.5 but it wouldn't let me do that on the stars.
"This review is not for the food or dining, it's only for the reservation & host/management experience.  In short, making a reservation means nothing!  I reserved a table for 4 on Saturday night at 7:15pm to welcome my colleagues to a nice meal while staying at the M Resort & Casino.  It was crowded when we arrived, and the host snapped at us saying it would be another 30 minutes for our reservation. I asked if we could go to the bar while we wait, and she said there was no room there either.  So we went to a Casino bar & came back 30 minutes later, and the manager told us it'd be at least another 30 minutes.  They weren't at all polite, they acted like we were being a pain for coming back. SERIOUSLY?!  So I asked them to take my number down & call me when the table was ready, and she begrudgingly did.  Well, they NEVER called me to say our table was ready.... good thing we snagged one at the Burger & Brews place next door.   Clearly, Anthony's doesn't know how to manage their reservations.... obviously an OpenTable reservation doesn't guarantee you a table.  We were super let down because the menu looks great, but I can't comment on that."
"This place impressed me. It is in kind of a bad location not noticeable from the street on Pleasant Valley and Broadview road however through word-of-mouth I've heard about this place and when I went... Wow. Some of the best sushi I've ever had, The Chinese food on the menu was much better than 90% of the Chinese places in the area.  The quality of the food was exceptional. I keep on craving this place but just haven't got back yet. I will be back for sure"
"So... arrived at ~5:30 and sat outside... ordered by 5:35... then we waited... and waited... and waited. No one checked on us (2 people) until 6:15. At that point, we asked for our food to go. Got that and the checks at 6:20. Finally able to pay and leave by 6:30. Probably some of  the worst service I have received. At least if you are running behind or food is taking awhile, you come back and explain and/or apologize. Instead, we were left wondering and waiting for our food. Obviously that never came until we said we were going to leave and take it with us. You would think at that point they would have apologized or taken something off the check, but no, nothing. Chances are, I won't be back. That is unfortunate, as we spend a lot of time in the area and this would have been a great outdoor spot! To top it off, when I got home and opened the soggy boxes, I was very disappointed at what I paid $11 for."
Best veggie hoagie I've ever had! Way better than going to subway and getting something bland and run of the mill :)
Very good but a little pricey though. The fire in the bar area is very cool though. The food is good. Very nice place
"First time in this place. Pretty impressive. I liked the lemon popcorn chicken with green onions..good flavor and sauce. The soy garlic chicken wings were a little too sweet actually, I wish they were a little less sweet and more garlicy. Bimbap was excellent. Delicious and very comforting. Of course all the sides great as usual with Korean Cuisine. Overall, we were pretty happy. Service was good, even though I've never been a fan of pressing a button to get the server's attention. I am not sure where that started but it's a bit  awkward and not very classy. Would come back and have a few other things on the menu."
Food is average. Service is mostly good.   Tried almost every breakfast plate as well as the burgers.  Look elsewhere for good eats.
"Other than being served pretty cold (through the drive thru), the food wasn't that bad.  Would have been way better warm though."
"I don't think I've ever had this type of cuisine before, what a treat. Got there around 8 and it was packed with indians and hipsters ;) The vegetarian dosa is quite good, we also the lamb biryani. Had to wait a little for a table but service was fast and friendly."
"First time but not our last!! Never knew it was there and authentic,friendly staff..amazing food!!"
"OK - we were so sad and bummed when Momma Mias didn't come back. It was our go-to pizza place and it killed us! The we found out about this and were sooooo excited. Now normally, I think you would want places to be different or unique or doing their own thing, but I am so happy that these guys kept to the simple amazing pizza they had before! It was so good and so nice to have something close and back that we love! The wings were great too! Delivery was wicked fast!   Guess we will be back to Sunday night pizza again :)"
"Great little park in the midst of downtown Pittsburgh. A lot of different walking trails, food vendors and a nice place to just chill with friends. Our group met up here for a little tour through downtown Pittsburgh and it was a convenient initial meeting point to get us started.  There's a great view of the Cathedral of PIttsburgh from the plaza and some great potential photo's for us tourists. There's also opportunity to play disc golf here and you'll often see artists, University students, hipsters, families just hanging out in the park.  The only downside is the downtown parking, although there is plenty of pay parking surrounding the plaza at $2/hour."
"This place is located at the heart of Eastern so it's always packed. Food is mediocre. Ordering is very confusing and there was no staff to ask or usher the guests in. With the music too loud, you actually have to shout to the food preparers what you want to order. Pricing was not too bad, though."
"First time ordering from them, the wings are really good and I also got the pig snackers... the texture of both are amazing, just a tad crunchy... amazing, but the fries were waaaaay  waaaaay too salty. I know they would be the best fries, if they had a dash of salt instead of a pale of salt. Besides all that, I will def be coming back."
Good selection of specialty pizzas. $18 range on large but very tasty for hand tossed pizza.
"Since everyone in my family digs Tandoori Times, I've wandered in for eight or nine earlybird dinners and, honestly, I'm a little underwhelmed.  Definitely not bad or awful, but maybe if I sandwiched a later supper  between undulating bare bellied vixens and a couple of Kingfishers, I'd stumble out with a hazier (and happier ) overall impression.    Nothing I've ever eaten here was truly bad enough to take back - or savory enough to inspire a return visit. Portions tend to be small and sauces are, by and large, mild and rather one dimensional.  Other than the garlic naan, I cant  remember a dish smelling really awesome as it wafted by, which is a shame considering Indian cuisine is among the world's most aromatic.     I was eager to share yesterday's lamb boti kabob, as the portion was good sized - about 15-20 small cubes of lamb (not mega kabob sized cubes, but a very respectable portion for $10-11), on the usual tandoori bed of onions and peppers.  The lamb exterior was nice & crusty, but the inside wasnt moist and tender like you'd expect from tandoori - instead it was hard, chewy and disappointing.  Companion's entree was 3 tiny vegetable fritters or dumplings buried in a thick sauce, that looked more like an appetizer.  Chicken dishes are generally better - the tandoori version is good, and similar to most Indian joints.  I recommend the three hot relishes (red sauce, green puree, and pickled peppers) provided tableside, as house preparations, at least in my experience, tend to be mild.   Servers are generally Anglo, pleasant and competent during the meal, but just about every time we walk in for dinner at 5 or 5:30, the entire operation seems almost startled by our presence. Nobody's overtly rude, but instead of a really warm welcome, you kind of get four or five employees hanging out at the bar staring at you, as if mentally choosing straws to see who has to deal with the first dinner customer of the evening. It's not oppressive, but it's happened more than once and I'm not crazy about the vibe.    I do like the complimentary, self serve chai tea and open kitchen, providing an opportunity to stretch one's legs and socialize a bit. Nice touches.   The menu is extensive, all told about sixty items, and reasonably priced for Indian food. Indian textiles, jewelry and artwork is often on display, for sale, and the house music is too loud if you have the misfortune to be seated under a ceiling speaker. It got turned down, eventually, but any restaurant with a few years under it's belt ought to understand customary American tolerances better than that.    The atmosphere is up and down. Food's OK. Service is OK. Ask my family and they'll each give it four or five stars. In my book, Tandoori Times is just OK."
"Before we went to see ""Love"" at the Mirage, my boyfriend and I came in for 7 pm dinner reservations at Onda.  We've lived on Maui for a few years now, and it's almost impossible to get our hands on good Italian food.  I came into Onda hoping to be wowed, and I was not disappointed.  The bar area is small, brightly lit and walled with wine cases, while the dining area is dark and quiet with plush booths.  We were greeted by our server right away who was incredibly helpful as we negotiated the extensive wine list.  He made recommendations and brought us tastes.  We really appreciated his expertise and helpfulness.  After we ordered wine, we started with the Meatballs Appetizer.  Two were served on a platter with a homemade marinara sauce, topped with golden crusted goat cheese.  What a perfect way to start our dinner.  This is a must-order.  We also split a Caesar Salad.  Large leaves of romaine, not chopped, and perfectly dressed with some of the best croutons I've ever had.  For our main meal, we took our server's suggestion and ordered the Burrata Agnolotti Pasta and the Veal Osso Bucco.  The pasta was served with chunks of lobster and sauteed chanterelle mushrooms in a roasted corn butter sauce.  The veal slid off the bone when I used my fork (I barely had to touch my knife at all, the veal was so tender), and the accompanying saffron risotto was incredible.  Needless to say, the dinner was incredible.   We ordered the Tiramisu for our dessert and practically licked the plate clean.  Earlier during our meal, when we were deciding what to order the sommelier informed us that they do all the pasta dishes to order.  Each pasta is handmade in the restaurant and cut to order, so, upon request, they will do half orders of all of their pasta entrees in case you can't choose just one.  Next time I make it to Vegas, I'll have to take them up on their offer.  Amazing food, wonderful service.  You won't be disappointed at Onda."
"The meal is decent. We ordered a chicken souvlaki and the chicken was freshly grilled and the potatoes was in good portion.  The greek salad that came with it was a little disappointing. They didn't even use greek dressing on it. I think it was just italian or something. Not that great, I used some of the tzatziki sauce as dressing.   Price is maybe double compared to a Mr.Greek on a food court somewhere."
Walked out of the place without even being acknowledged by the staff while they were talking with each other. We were completely ig
"I have been on a quest, since moving to Arizona, to find NY Style Pizza. Other places just add ""NY Style"" to their storefront, but fail to deliver. I tried 1 slice with Xtra cheese and meatballs...and I literally pictured myself walking in NYC eating a slice of NY Pizza. They delivered on their claim and the service was wonderful! Two thumbs way up!"
"Hmmmm. Well we waited forever to get our food. Not sure if it's any good but after an hour wait on a not so busy day, the only activity we saw that was quick was getting our check after we complained about the wait. What a shame.   Doubt I will be back. Service was awful.  Still can't believe the manager allowed us to walk out of there without trying to make amends."
"The only reason they're getting 3 stars is for the food ...which is GREAT. Unfortunately, Nothing beats quality service.  I visited this establishment at least 3 times a week during my lunch for the convenience and good food, but was always met with such disrespectful tones and demeanor from the wait staff. I have been going here for a while so I will say not all of the employees are bad, but too bad the only pleasant worker is on the grill !! If you're looking for some great hibachi, definitely give this place a try ...just make sure you drop your money, grab your food, and run! I, however, have given them enough my money and will not be returning. I like to get the entire quality experience- food AND service !"
Beef plate as well as the chicken were delicious. The soup was amazing with the freshly brewed tea.
I love this place. Always get the chicken kabob which comes with lentil soup or salad. Delicious!!! A little more expensive than jasmine grill across town but a great alternative when on the East side. Don't interpret the gruff nature of the owner as rude just enjoy your delicious meal.
Great atmosphere and the owner was super friendly and funny! I had the butter chicken and it was super delicious. The mango lassi was rich and not too sweet. Definitely would go there again :)
"My first time tonight - pretty good food. Service lacked BUT Heather saved the night by stepping in and up.   Parm Fries yum. Green Chili Pork - meat needed seasoning but put with the tortilla, squeeze of lime and pico made it tastier. Will be back to try some of the other menu items."
"SO GOOD. Funghi appetizer, ravioli main (pasta is made fresh daily) + glass of rose+ friends+ friendly service= perfection. Super cute/romantic atmosphere. Come here if you're trying to impress on a first date. Come here if you're like me and enjoy wining and dining with good friends. Coming back."
"The Rail does a lot of things right. The food is fresh, well-priced, and tasty. The restaurant itself is very nice, with a bar separating the booths and tables from the patio area; this makes access to drinks very convenient. I will say, though, that the service really hits it out of the park!   Happy hour is great and on top of that they also have a specially priced drink all day for particular days of the week. For instance, Long Island Iced Teas are $3 all day on Fridays.   Honestly, the only thing I would change is the a la carte sides...I think it's unAmerican to serve a burger without fries. Keep up the good work Rail, I love ya."
"I had to give them a one star cause there is nothing less then one star.  A group of 9 wanted a nice last meal nothing came even warm to the table after waiting an hour to receive it.  Scallops where not even cooked, baked potatoe was cold, steak was room temperature, and after the reviews we wanted lobster mac and cheese there was no lobster in it at all and we had 3 of them.  Broccoli Raab was a few steamed frozen broccoli crowns that was sent immediate back.  They made 18% gratuity and did a lousy job I'm sitting here writing this as I'm waiting for my check because they are so slow.  Go anywhere but here, especially if you want a nice meal like we did."
"Parking is a little tricky, but it's totally worth it for this local gem! I'm a traditional sesame and cream cheese kind of girl, but the friendly guy at the counter suggested the pimento BLT on asiago, and I went for it. Hot and melty and crispy and quite possibly this BEST bagel sandwich I have ever had. I want it again tomorrow!"
"Pinball machines are slowly working their way out of society, so I'm glad a place like this exists. A wonderful and loving tribute to a great past time. Lots of rare, unique, and long forgotten tables that you can play for the 1st or 100th time. There's plenty of famous tables (LOTR, Addams Family, Ripley's) that have had color conversions too. All tables are well cared for and while there's always a handful of tables that are broken they seem to actually fix them. Ample parking and low table prices. $5 or $10 bucks will get you plenty of play time. It's not walkable from the strip, but a cab or Lyft wouldn't be too expensive as you're just to the east. Highly recommended if you have even a passing interest in Pinball."
"Had an amazing lunch here a while back! The lineup for this food truck usually isn't as long as some of the other ones, and you get your food fairly quickly, which is definitely a plus, since food trucks are generally supposed to be fast. I got the DBL (not the combo) for $8 and it was amazing. The DBL is two pieces of schnitzel with cheese, bacon, sauerkraut all inside. Especially since I'm not the greatest fan of bread or buns, this sandwich/burger was simply perfect. Although the DBL looks small initially, it will fill you up for a nice lunch and the schnitzel is done to perfection - not too oily, but still very crispy and satisfying.   But be prepared though, this isn't a salad or an extremely balanced meal, so if you're looking for some greens, then it might be better to save this for cheat day."
"All last week, I was sampling different wing places for the best wings. And, I chose wing time! I came in last week and got a little combo just for myself. The combo was just what I wanted, six pieces of wings, with two different flavors. Some blue cheese, french fries, Texas toast. Not to mention, a drink! You get a lot. I did get a little side order of carrots, but it wasn't expensive at all.  Today, we were feeding the wonderful volunteers that are remodeling our church. They are so kind & generous for devoting their free time to our church. So, I placed an order for the 30 wings special. I ordered it ahead of time and it was ready when I got there. Everything was there. And, I really like the way that they separated the cold items and put them in a separate bag.  Everybody loved the wings including myself. I will definitely continue coming here either for the lunch special just for myself or if in the future, there will be another party, I will definitely get their large wings special deal again! I really love their wings! They are perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned. Plus, they have the best customer service!"
"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants but the quality has dropped precipitously. The food is no longer anything special, and the service can be downright hostile. The last two times we've eaten here, our server (older middle-aged woman wearing way too much perfume) was very rude. Most recently, she made us wait 10 minutes before she came to our table, even though we were the only ones in the restaurant!   She asked if we wanted menus (who asks that question?), then literally fewer than 3 seconds later, asked if we were ready to order. I could feel the animosity radiating from her. We tipped less than 10%, and this still was overly generous. I used to be a waiter, and have only tipped less than 20% in 2 restaurant visits - this is out of probably thousands of visits.   The food is now bland and tastes like fast food Chinese. Even the chicken coconut soup doesn't taste right, and that was their best dish.   It's a damn shame; this used to be one of my favorite restaurants. I'm guessing it was bought by somebody who simply doesn't care, and that attitude is reflected by the staff.   The good ratings here are probably remnants of old visits - I would stay far, far away from this restaurant."
"WOW!  That's all I have to say.  Not sure what happened since the last time I was here, but it was like going to a completely different restaurant.  Horrible, rude service from BOTH of the waitresses, not just from the one that all the other people here have mentioned--tall, nasty, and always has a look on her face like someone just took a crap in her cereal.  And I sort of got the impression that because I am gaijin (ie: not Japanese) I may have pissed them off even more.  Food still tasted the same (great) but the ambiance and the attitude really, REALLY rubbed me the wrong way.  Needless to say--no tip.  I would have RELISHED the opportunity that the other reviewer had when tall and nasty followed you out to the parking lot and demanded a tip--I guarantee she wouldn't have found that to be a pleasant experience.  You all just lost a customer and a fan--congratulations nasty face!!!"
Jason recommended the penne shrimp dish its was awesome. Definitely request Jason as your waiter. We will be back
"Food is Amazing, fresh, yummy. Service is fast and staff is professional and OVER THE TOP ATTENTIVE. Austin, was amazing for Breakfast, wait staff breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert was 1st class!!!"
"ordered a combo burrito, very little chicken, a lot of beans, also come with 8 pieces of chip, for 8 dollar, not worth it at all, i rather go Roberto on Fort apache, much better at anything"
"I've been to the Ajax location and didn't have the best experience. I would still give the Ajax location another try because maybe I just had them on an off day. The butter chicken was not creamy and did not have enough sauce in it at all, chicken was dry.  THIS location on the other hand, the interior was clean, staff were very friendly (not that they werent at the other location) The butter chicken was so delicious! The white meat was well cooked, moist on the inside, the portion of sauce to meat was perfect and the sauce was seasoned with all of the right ingredients making it so creamy.  I also really enjoyed the chicken poutine. It had lots of flavour and im a fan of their fries, crispy and yummy.  I would go back to this location! :)"
Great Chicago style pizza.  Sat outside to enjoy the weather.  Very attentive server.  Reasonable prices.
"I will, for once, reserve my words:  Get you to this place and check it out yourself!!  'nuff said."
"I love chefs Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger, so I was looking forward to experiencing the restaurant during my stay.  The first night we ate at the bar and had a blood orange margarita with a mole rim and the citrus chicken quesadillas.  It was so good I did not want to stop eating, but I was stuffed.  On my last day, we had lunch there, also at the bar.  It was happy hour so the drinks were a little less expensive.  I had the spicy shrimp tacos.  Food, drink and service are phenomenal.  Prices are average; not overly pricy, but not cheap.  You are paying for quality in food and service, so just do it.  Go there.  Eat there."
"One of the best pizza places around, and ran by great people!! Always friendly service!! One of the rare treasures of Elyria!! Me and my daughter love this place!! If you haven't tried it you should try the pierogi pizza, it's delicious!!!!"
"I can't believe the service. So kind, patient and reasonable. The food is even better or just as good as the people. I come back time and time again and although it may be slow on busy days, their attitude and kindness blows me away enough that i dont mind being patient myself :) always returning!"
"This resto has ""meal of your life"" potential! To start, the bread and pesto is to die for. I ordered the half caesar salad, and my loving girlfriend had the half beet salad. Both were nice presentations and incredibly tasty. For main I had the goat cheese tortelli. Will not lie, one of the best meals ever. The duck confit was cooked to perfection. Very tasty and well worth the price. GF had lasagna, and it was just as good as the tortelli. Highly recommend this place...will return!"
"This is such a fun addition to University circle.  I've been here twice; both times to watch football games.  There are at least twenty widescreen tvs here.  Its two stories with bars and bowling lanes on each floor.  They take reservations and have valet  parking.  Both times I got the chicken tenders.  I wouldn't come here specifically for the food but rather for the ""activity dining"" atmosphere.  Bowling for walk ins is 35$ per hr but 50$ per hr for reservations.  The shoe rental is 3$.  The entrees are 10 to 20$ and mixed drinks around 8 to 10$.  This is my go to place to watch big games.  Bowling here with a group friends will always make for an enjoyable event."
The best pizza in Las Vegas. The people working there are nice and polite. Love the place. Very clean place too.
"The crepe is a must try at this store. The drink is quite sweet, including both cold and hot drinks. The desserts in the cooler are terrible, looks nice for Instagram pic though."
"The owners of this restaurant have another location in Charlotte that has been open a very long time, and I can't, for the life of me, figure out why! My husband and I LOVE a good deli and were so excited to see this place so close to home. The excitement wore off about 5 minutes into the visit. Service was okay, but felt like I had to order and get out in record time. I ordered a Ruben and my husband ordered a corned beef sandwich. They should be ashamed of themselves with the quality of bread and corned beef that they serve. The cole slaw and potato salad tasted like they bought it packaged from Walmart or Sam's Club. There is nothing special about this place and I can make a better corned beef brisket at home, which isn't saying much. Skip this place. Sadly we still have to wait to get a good New York deli in Charlotte and surrounding."
The donuts here were amazing.  This is the donut shop formerly known as Presti's.  I won't explain in detail just how good they are because it would just be mean since they are now closed.  I just drove by and called them.  There is no more Gillys.  sniff...
"Pleasant surprise to find a Quiznos open, even better when I actually had the sandwich. Tasted great.  It's a shame there aren't more Quiznos like this one."
Awesome truck...can't wait for brick and mortar location to open.  The Nash-Vegas Hit Chicken is the best in the West Coast!!!  House pimento is amazing!
"I'm torn on how to review this one.  The pros: The ambiance and decor are super cute. Like a dressed up farmhouse.  The food is good and very ""farm to table"" (that's so hot right now).  Good selection of cocktails.  Nice patio.  Open for lunch.   Cons: The prices are pretty high. For food that includes sandwiches and salads, you are paying in the teens for each dish. Drinks are equally expensive.  Service is hit and miss (from my 3 visits). They're friendly and all, but sometimes just seem to forget about things like clearing dishes or refilling drinks.   Bottom line: it's a cool place with good food, but I won't go again unless somebody else requests it."
"So I needed a beer and had never been to Tyber Creek.  Not sure what's kept me from going, maybe I think I had the feeling it was a little neighborhood joint and it's not IN my neighborhood or something.    Either way, this is a pretty cool, sort of outdated, friendly bar.  Irish bar with plenty of great and cold beers on tap as well as an appetizer and bar menu that can compete with the best of them.  Friendly bartenders keep the drinks coming and it's not hard to tell why people like this place.  It is definitely a come as you are kind of place and I like that."
"Love this place! Very high quality, if not pricey food. The reason for this 5 star review is for their happy hour. The prime burger is one of my favorite burgers in town & during happy hour it's only $7 for this quality bacon burger. You get your choice of cheese ( I get blue) & a side of fries. If your a burger lover check out one of the best deals in Vegas."
"Red Robin is hopping on a Friday night...service was great. Go Matt!  Attentive, friendly, and efficient. Our burgers were delicious and those fries are the best.  I had the DGB ...I heard music with the first bite.  What a wonderful combination of favors.  My son had the Royal burger and the egg was beautiful.  He complained that the bacon tasted like microwave bacon....but managed to eat every bite.  Red Robin....hummmmmm"
"This place is always chaotic.  Super super super busy, but that's because it's really fun!  As a girl, I know a lot of girls wouldn't be comfortable or have fun golfing at a ""driving range,"" but that's why Top Golf is so great, because even if you don't want to play, you can just hangout and eat/drink with your friends who are playing.  Whether you're coming here for a date, birthday party, in a big group, or whatever it may be, this place is great for people of all ages.  The atmosphere itself is really fun and it's just a super cool idea that's entertaining."
"I have been eating warm pies on location and buying frozen pies to eat at home ever since the first location opened.   I am a huge fan of their savoury pies! I honestly cannot pick a favourite because I like so many of their pies and decide on the flavour based on what I'm craving at the time. I enjoy the braised beef rib, beef 'n beer, butter chicken (slightly spicy), veg-ilicious, pulled pork. The seasonal flavours are great too!  I'd love to try the lobster shrimp, but it's been sold out whenever I visit.  As for the sweet pies, the cheesecake with raspberry is my fave!   I also enjoy the coleslaw. The dressing is tart and the perfect amount. The dried apricot adds a great texture and sweetness. I just wish the cabbage was chopped more finely. The carrots are julienned, yet the cabbage is chopped in large pieces, which makes for a tough texture."
Amazing Steak and Cheese... Better than any Philly one I have ever had... Takes a little while tom order and get your food but that's cause it's so good!! Great pizza too!
Great fresh burgers. I had cheese burger with fried egg side of chili onion rings. Price kind of high. Original LA is much better.
"Well, it was not amazing. There are better places in Charlotte to get sushi. And we were over charged for our drinks! Aside that, the service was great and the place is nice. Would I go back? Likely no."
"I go to this market some time. The good thing is that they open until 12 am so I can stop by this place late night. The bad thing is that those hispanic workers are very unprofessional.  I do speak Spanish and understand what they are saying in Spanish inside the store. My experience today was the worst... Three of Mexican workers were using nasty cursing words in front of the customers assuming that no one understood what they were saying, such as ""puta(Bitch or whore)' or ""chingado(F--- u)."" Those are extremely nasty & disrespectful cursing words and I was totally grossed out. I told them that they shouldn't use those nasty words in front of the customers then one of them joked, ""Puta means pretty in Korean."" Of course not.. That really insults Koreans and their culture. I was totally disappointed in their unprofessional act and attitude and would like to stay away from this store for a while. It doesn't matter what language they speak, but they should NEVER use disrespectful cursing words in front of the customers. End of the line."
"This place is an excellent place to go if you are in or around the Strip.  The food is delicious, prices are good, and staff is friendly.  Although i have only had the chicken, you cannot go wrong with it.  I have had the 1/2 chicken and also the crispy chicken burrito and both were very good.  In addition, I always get the yucca fries; my lunch order is now a burrito with yucca fries and all for under $10 and i can't finish it all.  In addition, always get the green sauce and use it to your heat tolerance.  It definitely has a kick to it, so mix it with some mayo especially for the yucca fries.  I don't know if I would drive out of my way to eat here, but it is worth going if you are close."
"TOTALLY GAUDY BUT GREAT! Spent my 26th birthday wknd here.  It also happened to be my first trip to Vegas, despite living in LA since I was 18--imagine that!  Anyhow, we stayed in suite with a step down living room and all the gold in that place made me wear my stunna shades--LOL!!!  Definitely check out the V-Bar.  The drinks are unique and this place is definitely for the 'grown and sexy'."
"This place is a hidden gem! We moved to Vegas from San Francisco last year and have been here several times since. I took some friends here last weekend, that were visiting and they fell in love with it too. The play yard in the back is a blast!! So much fun!! Drinks are super affordable. We had an adorable waitress named Anne Marie and she was awesome! Super nice, quick with our drinks, very attentive and personable. I've been a server before so I'm a bit picky but she was on it! Love this place!"
"if i could give a 0 star i would...  so my husband and i decided to try the Clicklist function of order online and pick up groceries curbside. we arrived at 7:01 pm and watched for well over 10 minutes through the glass at the associate that was manning the station took cell phone calls, cut paper with scissors, took a selfie and what not before my husband went into the store proper to ask about getting our order. well after a minute after returning to the car after talking to customer service we decided to film said associate. she took another call and what not and we have well over 4 minutes of footage of her doing nothing. at this point we hit the 20 minute mark of waiting and my husband went back into the store where he was met by the cs employee and the manager. they called the associate up and she admired she'd taken some calls and told us we should have called her to let her know we were there. the websites specifically states to stay in your car as they come out to you and no phone number or instructions to call are issued in the confirming email i received. the manager didn't even apologize for her employee or try to make amends just assured my husband our card hadn't been charged as of yet so we canceled the order. we went to the smiths on sahara and nellis our normal store which doesn't have the Clicklist feature. i told them what happened and they gave us the office number to the area and we will be calling them as well as submitting screen shots of my confirming email, my order confirmation number and the 4 plus minutes of video to their corporate email.   good luck explaining the cell phone usage."
Went here looking for gluten free fried chicken and found my new favorite place to eat! I hate going to the strip but for chicken like my granny used to make....I make an exception! It has best country-chic atmosphere and the manager is legit one of the nicest dudes you'll meet! Bar menu rocks too! Will he back again as!soon as we can. You rock Yardbird!
"In-N-Out is ok.  That's it, ok. I truly think most people go because they think it's a cool thing to do. Carl's Jr. burger,(the Big Carl) is a far better burger."
Food is good but they dont let you mix match like bdubs ... So for that u get two stars bruh
"Came here to meet my BFF, we had happy hour.  Everything was great, food, drinks, price, and service!  I love this place and the atmosphere."
"Let me start with positives. I've never had a bad (weak) drink at Kelly's, and I feel it's very reasonably priced. The only food I've tried was the mac and cheese, which was ok given how much it cost.  Kelly's has two major issues: cleanliness and service. The booths are covered in crumbs, regardless of the time of night, and the tables often need wiping. Mysterious sticky stains abound.  The service would be so-so if not for this crazy policy: let's say you sit at a table. No waiter has been paying attention to you, so you go to the bar to get a drink. Are you allowed to bring that drink back to your table? No, you have to drink it at the bar! It's a kind of catch-22.  For these reasons, I have to give a 2 star rating - there are better bars around."
I have NEVER had a bad meal there! Larissa has always been my server and she rocks! The salmon is great but she's the real draw! Great service makes a place!
"Holy smokes! This place is one time consuming portal of gimmicks and awful service. First, the service is not great and the overall experience is way too pricy. Now, never mind that the overpriced single dish indian entrees are mediocre at best ... for some reason a sword wielding candle balancing bellydancer is supposed to make for a good experience?   It was loud as hell inside, and then the bellydancing made any conversation entirely inaudible to the point where i had to ask my 'server' what he said numerous times. Now aside from letting children play with a massive sword by other guests, balancing candles on her head, and harassing patrons to get up and dance with her, the bellydancing was not only dangerous but unnecessarily noisy.  The food itself? Meh. Ive been to many indian places, this is the least impressive. But hey, we got to wait an extra hour before paying a $60 bill for 2 people."
"I can't remember when I had a lunch as good as today's ....wait.....the last time was when I was here last ....about 9 months ago. This place ROCKS!!   Ravi is awesome. I used to pick up lunch here weekly then sadly moved jobs and I  wasn't around the corner any longer.  If your lucky enough to be in the neighbourhood - do not turn down the opportunity to stop in and grab a bite to eat.   There are always daily specials and the menu is posted on the large blackboard as you walk in. There are only 4 or 5 types of wraps and they are all great !    If you get here just before noon you beat the rush, even if you get caught in the line - it's well worth the wait.  Every single item on the menu is terrific !    Today I brought a friend here for a quick lunch and we both had the combo of corn & crab soup and the lamb wrap !! ..........WOW was it fantastic !   The combo is a prefect lunch.   The restaurant is small and seats about 16 at a very large communal table and there are about 4 additional tables in the back space, or if you prefer to sit facing the street, you could be lucky to grab a spot at the window.    In the spring, summer and early fall the patio is open and it is a lovely space to have lunch.   Thanks Ravi - you and your team do a great job and I hope to return soon."
"Love it here. Scallops and Sea Bass are delicious. It's comfortable, a little pricey, but worth the meal."
"I'm updating my review.... yet again.  I've come back to this place, since it's like 2 min from my house  The sushi fish was better.  Average.  Edible.  Good for a quick fix.  Solid 3 stars."
We heard that they were preparing Pho.....it was delicious!  The crispy Vietnamese egg rolls were a nice compliment!
"The Venetian straddles the dual-aspect of early 21st Century Las Vegas very well.  It's got the appeal of calculated imitation that is the Adult Disneyworld but still has the polish of the Unrestrained Opulence that Las Vegas is evolving to--sort of Dubai with gambling.  The crowd here is very diverse, with wealthy foreign tourists both as guests and herded through the shopping mall under the auspices of paid tour guides. Certainly it's a monument to global ambition.  Indeed, Vegas is evolving, and I can imagine that when it opened the Venetian was the pinnacle of elegance on the strip.  While no longer at the summit, it still is a fantastic place to stay at.  The rooms are decorated in classic Italian motif, and are fairly spacious.  Some of the aspects of the room were showing their age (we did need to call maintenance at one point).    The property is indeed huge, with a lot to offer--top notch dining, upscale shopping, and considerable entertainment (Venetian troubadors, gondola rides, shows, casinos).  The scale of the operation can be put into perspective by recounting my check-in experience.  I felt like I was boarding a cruise ship with the crowds, the processing, the walk to the cabin--all excellently done, but if that's not what you are looking for in a vacation you may need to re-think the Vegas thing.  We went off-peak (during the week) and felt the room rates were a good deal.  If I ever go back to Vegas, I'll consider staying again."
Food is awesome! Been eating there since 2000. Pizza is good but I love the sandwiches. Chill vibe
"Snakes and Lattes has great customer service, this is a really important yet often overlooked aspect of any business. They are prompt in replies to emails and try to be as flexible as they can be. I made a reservation two months prior for June 22nd and at the last minute had to change it. They couldn't guarantee I'd get a table, but lo and behold everything worked out. I love that they text you to let you know your table is ready - I really hate getting phone calls.  Food prices are expensive, but with a $5 cover and no time limit I'd be happy to pay their prices. Everyone was really great, even when I was just popping in to buy a game. I love it here and will definitely be back with more people in tow.  Oh and the strawberry cheesecake milkshake is SO DELICIOUS.  My only criticism is they really need to get proper tables for the couch area. It's hard to play a non-board game like Carcassonne the City on tables with slats."
"Best fried chicken ever!!! The issue I persistently have with chicken is that it is not usually well seasoned. But the chicken at this place was wonderfully well seasoned. I mean even the bits closest to the bone are just as well seasoned as the surface meat. So every bite was absolutely delicious! It was very tender and moist  and not overly greasy. I come from the South and I have not had better fried chicken!  I ordered their Blue plate. I was doubtful about spiced watermelon with chicken. (I mean watermelon on a main dish with chicken?!?). But once I had it, it totally made sense! The sweetness and juiciness of watermelon goes delightfully with the fried chicken; it kinda acts as a palette cleanser and takes away any feeling of greasiness. Totally yum! Honestly, I think I'd always try fried chicken with watermelon after this. Don't be put off by this unusual combo! The spiced watermelon isn't overly spiced. I tasted salt, pepper and cilantro. It's very refreshing.  Only issue: portion sizes are little small compared to the usual American size portions. But it was a treat!"
"Fried Rice - Tasteless, Tasteless Chicken Wings - Dry, Dry Pot Stickers - Doughy, Doughy Yummy, Yummy - Isn't, Isn't"
"Horribly over priced! The selection was such a shame, very few dessert to choose from. Service was slow and not very friendly, It was are first time at the MGM how were we supposed to know !  will not be returning"
When there again. Figure I give it another shot.well nope same thing happened again another order of burnt toast. I love Denny's I honestly think they are better than IHOP. I'm going to have to find another one to go to.
Been there several times and every one has been a phenomenal dining experience. Very unique; I urge people to go at least once to experience a great restaurant with an old Vegas feel.
Since hiring a new gm this place has been worth coming to they make the ice cream like they used to I would highly recommend this location....
"We are two of many many regulars at Rainbow donuts. Good stuff!! Fresh delicious pastries (they are creative as well) and freshly made breakfast items. We usually get breakfast burritos and they are yum! Fast and delish, always solid service too!"
If I could give zero stars I would. My friend and I came 1/1/17 at 2:15pm (they opened at 2pm) when we arrived the hostess told us it would be a 30-40 minute wait for food because they were busy. We decided that we would stay bc the restaurant was small & the crowd wasn't very large; big mistake. After we were seated it took 10 minutes for our waitress to come over to the table for our drink orders. Then another 20 minutes for her to bring our drinks & take our order. After over an hour my friend was brought her meal; whiting & super cold grits. The waitress said they were putting my wings in now for my chicken & waffles; after over an hour. My friend asked for new grits and after ten minutes she still hadn't received new grits and my food had not come. It was now 4pm & I was over it. We had the waitress cancel our orders. During this extremely long wait for food (of which mine never came) our waitress not once checked on our table. The person next to us canceled his check after waiting so long for food. After paying for my mimosa (given to me in a red wine glass) the waitress did offer my friend and I an expired coupon for 10% off our next visit. I'll pass.
"Although I have been going to DeFalco's for years, my last visit was a waste. Two orders of side salads were not included in my take out order. So I returned and received them. Only to return home and find out my 4 orders of meatball subs were not even correct. How do you get meatball subs mixed up? SMH. Not worth the drive since I'm coming from Mesa for what use to be friendly and exceptional service and correct orders of what I order."
"Went there for late breakfast. Place was small but very clean. Choice was limited to Taiwanese style crepe rolls and Malaysian style breakfast. I had the chicken curry with roti chanai which was very tasty and portion was large and price was excellent compared to other Malaysian restaurants I have  been to. We also had the signature breakfast sandwich that was very tasty and prepared fresh. Hong Kong style milk tea was also good. If they could have froth up the milk ,it would have been a great cup of Teh Tarik. I think there is room for satay on their menu since they already use charcoal grill for their toasts. It is a good place for a quick bite for sure. Good service great food at a very reasonable price. I hope to return to sample the bah kut teh among other foods."
"This Rubio's is located within the Monte Carlo Resort & Hotel in the food court. The prices are a little steeper because of this but that doesn't stop me from eating here. The customer service I receive is always friendly, they have a smile on their face and for the number of customers they are serving during the lunch rush, the food comes out quick.  Their burritos are my favorite. I love their tortillas and their pinto beans. I normally get the kids meal because the regular sized burrito is way too big for me. Their chips are delish...sometimes they need a little salt. If you can make it to dessert then get their churros. They are bomb! Oh and they have a nice little salsa bar with a variety of different salsa and sauces. If you get a soda with your meal then you can get free refills (which is unheard of for a casino!).  Besides burritos they also have street tacos, enchiladas, salads and quesadillas. I have heard fabulous things about their fish tacos. Also, they serve breakfast! OMG their bacon, egg and cheese breakfast burrito is to die for. They don't skimp either, that thing is jam packed with all the goods. Yum yum!"
"Was on the far West side of town and wanted to try something different then the norm. My daughter and I stopped in to grab a bite. I had the Hawaiian Dog and Euro Fries, she had a plain hot dog with ketchup (boring). Anyway I was a little surprised when everything rang up to a little over $25 dollars, but hey like I said not the norm, right? Well the food was really good and tasty and worth it! Check out the pics."
"Servers look you in the eye then ignore you when you are the only customer standing at the bar wanting a drink. Incredibly, egregious customer service."
"This was the absolute best meal (and cocktails) I've ever had.  Chic atmosphere and great date spot. Do yourself a favor and add this restaurant to your Must Eats!!!  Our server, Brandon gave us the best recommendations and we couldn't have been more pleased with his service.   MUST EATS: Trios of Picos and get the side of Guac. It comes with chips, plantains and arepas ... Chicharrones - my boyfriend said these were the best wings he's ever had! The onions and sauce made the dish!! For entrees, get the Braised Short Rib and Brazilian Beef Tenderloin. We both agree they were phenomenal.   MUST DRINK: Chica-Rita - holy cow - the most amazing drink!!!! Not on the menu, but Brendon also whipped us up a Mezcal Old Fashioned, which was nothing short of perfect."
"Very good, authentic Malaysian Food.  Ayam Redang was excellent, great service, will be back again.  Roti Canai was not greasy and authentic, loved it."
They were very manipulative and literally ripped us off. Don't go there because the price is absolutely not worth the food!
"The most bland tasting Italian food that I have ever had! Unfortunately, the only good thing was the cappacino. Very over priced as well! The food comes out on basically an assembly line with a salad extremely drenched in dressing. Garlic bread was decent. I was very excited to go to this restaurant and it was a major let down for my family. We had linguine and clams,manicotti,and lasagna. Each dish was equally lackluster."
"This location does not offer daily specials, but the Maryland Parkway location does. They also don't seem very bright, but the portions seem bigger here than other locations I go to.  They do the Tuesday 99 cent deal for 2 pieces, which is a real bargain.  The regular menu is kinda pricey, so I'm stickin with the Wicked Chicken Basket for $3.99 whenever it's in season.  I miss the Popcorn Chicken special.  I always ask for spicy, and sometimes they mess up and give me regular.  Oh well.  :-P"
With fresh beer and seafood and service is really good here as they have an upstairs and a downstairs. I find that this location is usually packed; why not be they're so good. Food portions here go by the pound. This restaurant is a really good location for someone who truly loves to eat seafood. I will definitely be going back in the near future.
Avoid like the plague.
"I was a little disappointed in the speed of seating guests. I had an 8:30 reservation and was not seated until 8:45, aside from arriving at 8:15. After being seated, service was not bad. The food was tasty and they give you large portions. I had shrimp alfredo and was pleased. They serve you bread a salad before your entree and they are both delish! After your meal, they also serve cappuccino. It was very tasty. I love the ""hole in the wall"" ambience and decor. They even have the menu up on the wall lol. Overall it was a nice experience."
I came here for a party a few weeks ago so I can't rate this place as a restaurant.   It's a very upscale joint. Bartenders did a good job of quick service. Typically expensif drinks bottle service once specials were over; just about what one would expect.  The decor is modern. Large screens placed through the upstairs lounge. The DJ played some really great hip hop sets; really loved the music. I especially liked the upstairs outdoor patio area. Very cool place to hold a party!
"Tucked inside the lobby of the Holiday Inn Express next to the PNC Building, Sammy's is a little diner that serves up breakfast and lunch staples for prices that don't break the bank. One of the few downtown breakfast places open on Saturday, I was glad Sammy's was as good as it is convenient. Bacon here is crisp, potatoes are better than Huran St diner and my heart is still true to the people at PJs but this is definitely where you'll find me the next Saturday morning I get a taste for eating breakfast out in the East 4th neighborhood."
"Went with a party of six the other night and wasn't sure what to expect based on the mixed reviews.  They do not serve individual meals but rather small to medium plates meant for sharing.  I was very nervous about how this would work as we have very adventurous eaters in our group down to a pregnant picky eater.  Our water recommended 2 selections per person.  This ended up being a bit to much food.  The ratio of 1.5 per person would be better.  The food comes out as its ready,not all at once.  Be prepared in advance to share food. We ordered: oysters on the half shell with the siracha lime dressing ( some of our parties first experience-success), a meat and cheese board (jellies were weird-wouldn't order again), chicken wings, roasted chicken, lobster roll, sliders, macaroni and cheese, green beans, steak tartare ( skip), a breakfast dish, mussels and calamari. For the most part our entire table enjoyed all of the food and was very happy.  The rings were perhaps the biggest hit ( they are a little spicy and smokey)  resulting in one member of our party declaring we must perfect our smoking technique in order to do wings like that at home.  The green beans were also a big hit, which is shocking because we were not that excited about ordering beans. Overall we had a great time but it was in part because we were willing to share, work together on a menu selection and have fun. Go with an open mind, good group and you will not be disappointed.  There was some confusion with the beer flights ordered but our waiter (who was excellent) quickly corrected."
This is a great steakhouse! We celebrated my birthday here! Started with the calamari which was really good. Didn't expect the twist with the sweet chili sauce. Which it Is tossed in. Ordered the tomahawk ribeye medium plus was PERFECT! Super moist and tender! The best lobster Mac and cheese!! Can't forget about the blueberry lemon drop!!
"This shopping center has a pretty good store lineup and there are usually some good deals to be found.  Having been to outlet malls in other cities I can say this location is better than most outlets. The location is about 10 minutes from the Strip instead of in the middle of nowhere. It's not a long drive for any local since it's conveniently located near the 215/15.   There are a lot of stores and here and a large variety of store types. I like to come here for work clothing since they have several stores with good prices on dress pants and blouses (Ann Taylor Loft/Van Heusen). The Clark's store is a favorite since that is my primary shoe brand. It's pretty awesome to get a deal on a brand I was already planning to buy. I also love the Harry & David store for gourmet foods.  Look for Starbucks in one of the middle aisles for caffeine. The food options inside are dismal, but there are some okay food options in the parking lot in front of the mall.  This place can get really busy. I find the mall to be pleasant for an hour or two after opening, but just generally miserable after that time. I would recommend planning out which stores you'll visit and setting time limits to get the heck out of Dodge before all hell breaks loose.  The parking lot can be insane. As a local I can say that I hate even driving by here in the middle of the day during my lunch break. Wow, there is a lot happening here. People jaywalking, tourists making crazy lefts onto Warm Springs (just use the LV Blvd. exit!), and just general chaos. I do occasionally come here on my lunch break, but I park in a secret lot to avoid the chaos. No, I'm not telling where that is or how I get there. :)"
"The smell gets me every time!! Just came for the shakes late night but the food is always good! They are always on top of it! Bomb food... Just a tip: not good if you take it home, must eat in the car right away or inside"
"I came here because of the mac n cheese. And yes, it's definitely that good. But I've kept coming back because of the drink specials, old school cocktails, the awesome patio, and happy hour food deals.  The happy hour snacks are priced too good to pass up, but honestly, aren't really that special. I think I've ordered the tofu tacos 20 times and I never even really liked them that much, they're just too cheap to pass up. The tofu bites are okay, too, with spicy wing sauces but nothing too special there. The mac n cheese is amazing, like everyone has said, but it is a recipe for a heart attack and doesn't pair well with a night out drinking.  The cocktails, on the other hand, are crazy good. They have a classic menu with old-school drinks that I've never heard of before. A lot of them are knock-your-socks-off strong and unique, and one drink each day is on special, depending on the day of the week.  So I guess what I'm really saying here is, go to Kelly's for a fun atmosphere and grab a couple crazy drinks on the patio with some mac n cheese and sweet potato fries and you won't be broke or disappointed."
I love this place soo much i almost dont want to tell anyone about it...lol such elegance abd class...soo sexy
We ordered sisig and they told us it would be ready at 12:30. It was let ready till almost 2 pm and we needed it for a birthday party. The lady at cash didn't even care or apologize and was rude. I'll never go back there
"We went to this chain restaurant many people waiting but despite this the wait was not so long the waiters very nice and after seeing and rereading the menu we were ready to order. There was our mistake, we ask to order an appetizer and also the main dish at the same time  Then they brought us the main dinner first and they totally forgot about the appetizer also my husband order as a side order a bake potato which he didn't get it and I need to reorder again to a different server ."
"We were in the area and hopped in for early dinner. Since Mr. h and i were in the mood for tacos we ordered the chicken and fish tacos, along with two drinks (freshly made). The chicken tacos was ok, not great and the fish was better but not awesome. The food tasted very fresh but nothing made me want to come back to have more. Also it cost $27 total and if I were hungry when I came in  would not be satisfied unless I ordered a taco combo with rice.   The service was good and the food was served very quickly. But if I'm going to pay so much, I'd rather go to Kensington Avenue for tacos since it tastes better."
The Tuna Salad on wheat was okay. Too bad the staff are way more into talking to  each other than being friendly with customers.
"Been here twice now and loved it! Two of the best mojitos i've ever had. The cocktails are definitely worth ordering. The food, same category. I've tried 4 different dishes off the menu and they were all fantastic. Great service, even when it was super busy. Try it!"
"I've eaten here several times and is one of my favourite restaurants.  The food is delicious and they serve generous portions.  My favourites are the ceasar salad and the linguine with goat cheese and mushrooms. The servers are fast, polite and attentive and the owner is very personable.  He is always present and gives everyone personal attention.  The place is small and you may have to wait a few minutes for a table but it's worth the wait."
"I was brought here by my coworkers. It's become sort of a ritual at my office to bring any new employees or out-of-town visitors here for lunch. Kind of a test of character. We usually go at least once a month.  My typical order is jerk chicken fried rice and egg foo yung with another varying meat option. I've tried the black beans and have to admit they're pretty good but I'm just not a big fan of lentils. I prefer having more rice.  I love the egg foo yung. I dislike a lot of Americanized Chinese food dishes, but egg foo yung is one exception. My parents had a Chinese restaurant when I was younger and the egg foo yung at Chino's tastes just like my dad used to make, right down to the gravy on top.  I finally tried the Chinese BBQ pork a couple weeks ago and it was surprisingly good. Not authentic, but it had a nice flavor. I also like the emerald chicken, jerk chicken, and carnitas. My coworkers swear by the Jade Red Chicken inside a quesadilla. A strange combination, but it's actually really good. I've heard that machaca inside a quesadilla is also good.  Finally, who doesn't love a free snickerdoodle cookie?"
"Just a little update-  The Klondike no longer offers any table games. So no more 10 cent roulette and no more $2 blackjack. This was a huge surprise because the 10 cent roulette was the huge draw of this joint. Without the table games, all you're left with is an extremely run down casino that has such a thick layer of cigarette smoke wafting around that it's like you're walking through a Vegas gambler's fog. I think the only thing that's left are the slot machines... I wouldn't be surprised if they tear this place down and start over from scratch. Might be the best thing. (by the way, I was going to rate this place 4 stars if they still offered the table games, but with those gone, there's nothing left to draw you in)"
"Arrived to spend some time at a bar that looked like it had a decent atmosphere after our flight was cancelled.  However my wife and I were overwhelmed by the number of fruit flies. It was bad just when we were having drinks. When the person next to use ordered some food, it became seriously disgusting. Can't comment on the food because we are going to move on to somewhere else."
"Any drinks other than beer, don't even bother.  They're extremely watered down. As in nooo alcohol...     Anyways on to the review. $4.95 for everything on the menu EXCEPT DRINKS!  I got the baja shrimp tacos. They were okay. Ask for hot sauce on the side because they are pretty bland.   The tilapia is pretty good so get that.  The burger is good. Get that too.   I was pretty disappointed with the calamari. The rest was missing. We got literally 10 pieces and yeah I know it's $4.95 but damn."
"Note: This review is strictly based on the food at Fresh and not the juices and such.  First off I'm not a vegetarian but can appreciate a good vegetarian food when I have one and the food at Fresh was VERY bland (yes even for vegetarian food).   I had the dragon bowl with the noodles and the sauce and vegetables and tofu had next to no taste (a little marinade with the grilling would go a long way). There was however some bean wrap (starts with a K) that was pretty tasty but that was pretty much it from the bunch of items we had on the menu.   The place looked alright, but was far too expensive for the sub-par food (my dragon bowl was just $14 for sub-par fast food almost). Not only that but maybe they should've moved the juicer to the back or got someone who knows how to juice considerably haha. The juicer man kept freaking the bejezus out of the whole restaurant everytime he stuck a fruit / vegetable in the juicer and the thing would give out this awful extremely loud noise that would shut the whole place up and it would become awkwardly quiet.  Anyways I give this a 2 stars for expensive sub-par fast food, uninteresting (overdone) design, and food creation tactics. It seems the chain is just trying to catch on to the healthy vegetarian food craze and make as much money as they can while sacrificing originality and good food in the process."
"Id give a 3.5 closer to a 4. Customer service is great, i called in my order and had my bf pick it up. Was very easy to order no issues straight to the point. Also when my bf picked up the food he told me how nice they were which is another plus.  The food is typical western chinese food. The one thing i loved mosy was the chicken balls was actually more chicken then dough. When does that ever happen lol.  We also got fried chicken wings also greasy and yummy . Just what i wanted fresh/crispy. Chicken fried rice was as expected no complaints. Lastly the chilli chicken , which is why i said 3.5 and not 4. It was full of veggies barely any meat. Also was not spicey at all. But i guess its western chinese food and they know we cant handle spice lol"
"The food here is DELICIOUS, FLAVORFUL, over all just SUPERB!!! Management and staff are super friendly. We were originally ignored when we walked in everyone was being helped except us. I was upset and almost walked out. I'm so happy we waited! Once the mix up was cleared management went above and beyond to apologize to us and JoJo our waiter was super attentive and made great recommendations. P.S Steve(manager) you are great!!!"
Love this place for local Thai!  Great service.  Love the green curry and Mango tilapia .  Spring rolls are good and brown rice! ( just wish it wasn't an upcharge). I travel around and glad to have a local Thai pace. Pumpkin curry is great too!
Originally from NY - I have been looking for a good place for nearly 20 years.  This is some of the best NY pizza I have ever had in AZ.  You know its good when you fold it in half and the orange oil drips off the tip.  yyuummmm....pizza heaven.  I'll be back!!
"I can't do Italian food unless it made by my mother, grandmother, or grandfather. All who descend from Sicily. However, this place silences even the most difficult critics. Each dish made with care, the kitchen obviously has a deep respect for this cuisine. And the employees treat you like family. Overall an authentic Italian experience."
"Went here because my girlfriend loves Greek food. There isn't a whole lot of Greek restaurants in Madison so we thought we'd try this. It did not disappoint, it had a very authentic feel and the food was delicious. If you're looking for Greek food in Madison this is definitely the place to go."
"I gave this place two chances, both for brunch. Because I really want to like it... BUT Both times the food was too greasy for me to eat, and both times the people I have been with, also did not enjoy their food. This last time one of my friends had to send his food back because it was too salty (the ham) and too greasy (the toast). They were nice about it and did not charge him.   BOTH TIMES I have tried to convey something to the serving staff, in hopes that it gets to the kitchen- that food is greasy  and items are inedible. Twice the staff has cut me off mid-sentence, and responded that ""this is how item x is made,"" - as if customers were not eating at other restaurants (even the same dishes; something basic, like a hash brown!) without this trouble.  Some perspective: paying customers should be able to order food that they can and want to eat, no matter what. Always. Even if it's fried.  It's understood some items on the plate are fried in fat, but the dish should not be unpleasant, revoltingly oily, even if it has a fried component.  The hash browns are literally, round oil sponges. Disgusting.  This is the oiliest brunch in town. Hands down. It's a shame because the space is so beautiful and open.  It feels like maybe in trying to do things in a unique way, they are ruining them... even the simple ones.  I hope it changes!"
"Another great meal, got there late so had chopped brisket and sausage with pecan pie to top it off , great meal"
"I really, really want to like this place. 2 minutes from the house, great games for our daughter, and an amazing patio. But man oh man.... it is impossibly slow. Our waiter was great, but the kitchen continues to be a problem. On a Saturday mid-afternoon where it was not packed our food took forever. Beer gone. Waiting. Snacks gone. Waiting.   We really want this to work but now it has been 3 visits and 3 impossibly long waits.  Please pick it up!!!"
"When one thinks of sushi in Northeast Ohio, a place on the border of Parma next to a Subway and a convenience store is not going to come to mind. Thankfully though, the check cashing place is no longer there. As a result I had driven past it many a time without a second thought. A few months ago I figured that I might as well give it a shot.  I'm glad I did, to put it lightly. The service has been attentive each time I have been there, and the decor is nice. What surprised me is that rarely have I seen anyone else eating there. Either I'm there at the wrong times or others have made the same assumption I did. I had miso soup a couple of times while they prepared the sushi, and it is just the right blend of ingredients. I'm a snob when it comes to miso so impressing me with that is a big deal.  As for the star, the sushi, it is made fresh with care and it shows. The $3 happy hour rolls are delicious, and the specialty rolls are even better. The Parma rolls in particular have become my all-time favorite, despite the fact that it is not so much sushi as it is crab on a ball of rice.  After eating here, having sushi at the buffets and other restaurants in the area just isn't the same.  It's a must try if you are in the area, especially on Tuesday or Wednesday since one can easily fill up on two of the $3 basic rolls available on those days."
Excellent burger and the best onion strings ever and a glass of wine. Atmosphere is cozy and very clean. Will definitely be back.
"This is really the tale of two bars.    The positive is that drinks are cheap and the food is pretty good.  I've had few things in my stops there and I haven't been disappointed by food yet.  The wings are fantastic, the sandwhichs are filling, and the sides are tasty.    I go here when i'm waiting my girlfriend to get home from work on mondays and the bartender monday sucks running.  She can't focus on more than one task at once and therefore is constantly flustered which makes for an uncomfortable air in the bar area. I've witnessed one of her meltdowns actually clear a pretty full bar.  Dear owner, this trainwreck is costing you money...you might want to consider upgrading staff.  The times she hasn't been there and a capable staffmember has been working has produced fun experiences.  That said, given the location it is what it is:  a yinzer bar bordering a less than desireable area of town and has everything that comes with it."
"I have been here date nights or causal wine sipping numerous times since they have opened not even a month ago.  I'm very impressed with The Sparklings. I waited months and months for it to open and even asked ""when are you opening"" to a construction worker once :)  It is truly amazing the remodel that was done inside of this building. The inside used to have private hibachi rooms for goodness sake.   The ambiance of the former sushi joint  is now an updated and posh Martha Stewart worthy lounge. Whatever the hell that means, I just made it up. Sounds weird huh? Just look at the pics it's truly lovely. The chandelier that everyone takes pics of and talks about is magical.  The menu is a more causal (Sage like) menu. Modern American Fusion? Who cares about the title. It's just good food.   We have not ordered entrees here YET because we have already had dinner or were on our way to dinner on our visits.   They said that they can accommodate to vegan for us no problem. I look forward to a pasta or a special custom creation. The items that we have had (so far) are very good.  Portobello fries, flat bread, salads....wine, wine, and more wine :)  The service is super accommodating, almost too much service. I guess because they are newer they want to help and help a lot. Lol.  The over-service was only in the dining area. In the lounge the service is perfect.  I truly love the way the did the garage door in the lounge and the way the patio area looks.  I really want to sit in that left hand side back lounge booth with a ton of people. It's really soooo big it could fit 10+++ people. I love it. Their left side dining area private table would make a large gathering super fun.    I will update when we order full entrees and remember to take more pics since we are here soo much.   Just go, it's a marvelous addition to the beautiful SW area. I am proud to be a regular.     Oh and hubby said no I could not redecorate our whole house like the inside of The Sparklings :(((((((;  ;)"
"I read the previous reviews and seriously, what did y'all order?? I have been to Laredo over 6 times in 3 months and have had a very delicious, fresh and hot meal each time. My mom and I have eaten lunch and dinner there during on- and off-peak hours and have consistently good food. She is a very excellent cook herself and would tell the waiter if something was not to her liking. The salsa was perfect each time, with just the right amount of heat and spice, not overwhelmingly tomato-y or salty. In fact, I told the chef (who was leaving for the day) that I came from SF to have his salsa and he prepared a pound of FRESH chips and a pint of my favorite salsa to go, with a thank you note (he did this in less than 5 minutes). I've never had such consistently delicious food, great service, and wonderful dining moments in the area than at Laredo."
pretty good...love the burgers and the fries always hit the spot
"Awesome! Best jerk ever!  In fact, this is probably the best quick lunch spot I've been to in many, many years. This place is super good.  It's mostly a take-away business but either way, you can't go wrong.  Thanks Yelp, for suggesting this place!  Never would have noticed it otherwise."
"Bakery Wee created our baby shower cake, which was amazing!!!!  The taste was just as great as the looks!!!  Hoping to get our sons birthday cake done as well!!"
Wow  You better be hungry to eat here  Portions are massive  Will not disappoint  Sit at bar and chat up with friendly bartenders  Bloody Mary a definite try
visiting from New Jersey this week and wandered into Hurley's because i love Irish pubs. Went to two other ones in Montreal first and they didn't compare. Rod was a terrific bartender and incredibly friendly. The beer is about $8 a pint but that's worth it for the authentic feel of Ireland! I was in Ireland last year and this place really was like hanging out in Dublin. We were at Hurley's twice this week because we enjoyed it so much the first night. Highly recommend!
"Very good.  My husband categorized it as ""foofy"" and, indeed, most of the men looked like they had been dragged there. However, I thought the food was delicious and creative, and almost everything on the menu can be prepared gluten free.  He thought the iced tea was the best he'd ever had.  We strolled down the tracks to the farmers market after lunch and got blackberries, peaches, and a cast iron turtle."
"This was a first time walk-in visit....casual atmosphere, you use an iPad to select your dishes, and how many of those dishes you want.  Food came very quickly....BE WARNED.....for a party of four, all of you have to have a la cart/menu, two cannot have a la carte, and two menu.....Owner explained why we could not do this, and he was courteous about it and not rude, Customer Service was very good, attentive.  Food was really good and tasty, this is now one of our go to spots."
Huge all you can eat restaurant.  I have gone there many times.  Love the food. Like the grill where you can order your own stir-fry.  good selection of sushi.  very affordable price.
"Came in here looking for a lively country bar in Vegas, let me say this is not it. The bartenders and staff are very nice. The atmosphere has more of an older crowd, my friend and I were the only ones doing line dancing. We had an okay time. We asked for a special 9$ jar for both of us and received a bill for 50$! We let it go and went on with our night but even the nicest clubs in vegas are not that much! Added bonus everyon starts leaving around 12 and you yourself will have to leave before 1 or youll be bounced out too!"
"I used to work directly across the street from Ferraro so during the work week, I ended up here 3 out of 5 days.  This lead me to utilizing the restaurant as a last minute dinner spot as well.  For lunch, opt for the Griglia con Pollo salad.  I don't know what type of dressing they use but it is light and delicious.  The chicken is juicy, tender and falls apart in your mouth.  And the bread... oh the bread.  Warm, freshly baked bread makes my heart go pitter pat.  The wine list is good and there's a lot of variety so finding a bottle to accompany your dinner is a breeze.  You may find that the wine goes down too well here.  At least, I've found that... on more than one occasion."
Bagel was passable but nothing to rave about.   Service was quick.   The place was filthy.  Drink station was a mess. The corners were full of grime.  Where it was critical to be clean it was but still it bugged me.
"Sunday brunch is amazing! Delicious and vegetarian friendly and great service. Def do the chef's buffet with omelette bar. A bonus: the Chef and the owner greeted everyone, and the owner brought his family for brunch too."
"Went for my birthday dinner. So yummy! The decor is absolutely amazing. I fell in love, so classy, so chic, perfect for my bday celebration. I wanted pizza and what a good choice it was! We started with the chicken artichoke bruschetta! Excellent. Then had the four cheese pizza adding spinach. Delicious. Then they brought me a yummy dessert  I loved it!"
"Staff was friendly, food was good, restaraunt was clean and beautiful !! Simple place,  you could tell they care for it their. I came on a solo-date (treat yoself??) And had a good time, their Thai tea tastes kind of funky but that's about the only complain I have. It wasn't bad just 'off'"
Our guide recommended this place because of the terrace garden. The garden terrace is quite beautiful with very larg unusual umbrellas that catch rain water. We had the Boreale beer which is a local beer. My favourite was the rouge. The IPA isn't too bad either. We had the calamari and it wasn't the best but good enough. They have patio heaters so it was quite cozy.
"We live near this Denny's and service has been hit or miss so we normally avoid it. I wanted moons over my hammy so we went to Denny's and my husband even expressed his concern. I should have listened. There was one table with 2 people at it, at 9pm at night, that should have told us everything. We stood up front waiting to be seated, there was no one around to seat us. Then a waitress walked through the back and looked at us, I thought for sure she was coming up front. Wrong. She walked back and forth, didn't acknowledge our presence. Then a manager walked into the same area, looked at us and didn't smile, didn't say I'll be right with you, nothing. He turned around and started talking to the girl about some issue in the kitchen. He completely ignored the fact we were there. At that point we left. We went across the street to Village Inn (full parking lot btw). Imagine when walked in we were greeted and told they would be right with us. The manager saw us and immediately went to try and seat us while he was in the middle of something. I'm done with the Denny's. You have sealed the deal I won't be back and with the way things looked the restaurant sales won't keep you in business either."
"One of the better chinese restaurants on the strip that are both delish and affordable . I would recommend the fried rice , spicy cucumbers and beef noodles"
"I went here for my bachelorette party last year & was here last weekend with my husband and family. I would say it doesn't feel like a steakhouse, but more like a lounge that serves steak. I did enjoy the ambiance, very Vegas-like with the colorful lighting and the upbeat music. Reservations is a must.   We started with the caviar on creme fraiche & potato pancakes. Yummy.  For our entree we ordered the bone-in ribeye for 2 for $89. It was delicious! The service was excellent & our sommelier did a superb job. Along with the bottle of wine, we spent $200 for the 2 of us. Not bad. Can't wait to try their other dishes."
Changed owners and the name. Epic fail! Prices have almost doubled as has the wait time.
"Highs: Ambience, value, pizza and deserts. This is a genuine Italian grocery and I might shop here during the day when the crowds are smaller. The restaurant meals are cheap for what you get and word is out among the ASU students and young families. Pizza crust was chewy, crispy with just the right amount of char, like a good bread. Cannoli was outstanding, obviously had been freshly filled, as shell was perfectly crunchy and the sweet ricotta center had a nice clean flavor. Lows: Pasta and disorganization.  It was a packed Saturday night and they weren't prepared. The wine glasses and forks ran out. They had a weird ordering system where there were two cash registers, one halfway through the line. When one of the staff would become available they would open the halfway register, which meant that someone who was lucky enough to be there at that moment would get to order early, in effect cutting in front of the rest of us who had been waiting longer. Our ravioli and filled shells came out lukewarm. As Yogi Berra once said, ""Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded."""
"Tiny burger might as well have paid $1 at McDonald's for what I got, Las Vegas has the poorest customer service and quality unless you are on the strip. So sad wish I could get in touch with corporate this is sad AF. So close to California and I'm from Texas and it's way better there. Real ice cream shakes my ass, soft serve and tastes artificial, lying to your customers for sure,tasted like trash just threw it away. Negative 5 is more like it, couldn't pay me to eat here."
"They come out to our construction site everyday. The food is reliable, tasty, and appropriately priced. What really brings this place over the top is the people who work for them. There are two women who come out to our site on 44th St everyday and they are so sweet and friendly. Couldn't ask for anything more from a food truck. Plus it appears to be solar powered. That is a plus."
"Out of all the Jersey Mike's locations in Vegas, this is my favorite. I'm always greeted with friendly staff and their Philly cheesesteak sandwich is always on point with fresh ingredients. My husband always orders the #13 and is never disappointed. Anthony is always smiling at the register and Alex does an outstanding job making sandwiches"
Love this place!!! Always fast and food is good. Their wonton is always fresh and juicy. This place is better than the one at Midland. Must go for anyone who wants to try authentic HK wonton.
"Great Ramen spot.  Clean interior and just the right amount of background music.  Staff here is awesome, I saw one of the guys teaching the girls next to me how to use chopsticks.  Menu is tight and straight to the point - RAMEN.  Pork belly is great and the chef flame torches it to give it the perfect char.  Overall, great Ramen, service, and experience."
Great dinner and service. Very reasonable menu and I would say one of the only place to eat on water st.
"Waste of time and money. After arriving in town to visit family we headed to ""table"" for dinner. I ordered a burger medium well with pepper jack cheese. It arrived well done without cheese.  We had other issues with the 2 of the 4 meals ordered. The waitress was not listening and failed to correctly order one of the fish entrees. 12 bucks for an over cooked burger with a burned slice of cheese was a bit much. Sadly we ended up ordering pizza once we got back to the hotel.  Pretentious, eclectic and disjointed menu coupled with an overpriced and underwhelming food and service.  Enter at your own risk....."
"I always thought that if you're going to specialize in something, it better be damn good.   I came here with my boyfriend for lunch and we both ordered the rotisserie chicken sandwich. The sandwich had good flavours, however the server suggested that we change the slaw if we don't like horseradish. Really glad that I did because it seemed to make more sense with the slaw that we substituted. We ordered a side of fries as it is not included with the sandwich, and were presented with a hefty bowl of tasty shoestring fries which neither of us could finish.  However, the chicken was really dry. And when I say dry, I mean you need to soak your mouth with water to get some flavour and juice out of it. I always thought that rotisserie chicken was meant to be juicy, but this chicken seriously lacked the juice that you would normally expect.   I think this restaurant has a lot of potential, it's situated in a great neighbourhood, trendy indoors and nice patio that offer a warm welcome with very friendly service. In fact, I would say the service is the only reason that I'm giving it three stars.   If you're going to do chicken, at least learn how to make it right."
"Been to just about every Thai place in Vegas. Archis is definitely one of the best. Best beef noodle soup in town by far. Spent a month in Thailand and although the name kind of has an american feel, the food is authentic! So good! Do your self a favor and eat here. For the price, one of Vegas' gems."
"Warning!!! this place recycles rice and food. To my dismay, I observed the waiters pick out some rice parts from the rice bowls and then top it off. Later I saw one table had a leftover, they took it to the back, while they bussed the table and threw everything else away...hmm I wonder who they will serve that to! Avoid pork and clams, their meat is half rotted!!! Roast pork and duck taste ok. Also they do not take credit cards. Just avoid this place."
"Freaking love this place!! Kyle helped us and gave us samples of whatever we wanted to try. I ended up buying 3 bottles, Local Hottie, The Kitchen Sink, and Sweet Greens and also got a Green Milk shake. We also checked in on Facebook and got a free shot which was really nice, but the shot was super intense! It opened up my sinuses and cleared me right up. I can't remember the name but it had ginger, lemon, and cayenne pepper in it. It burned real good on the way down. Try it!"
"I grade sushi restaurants on 3 factors: - Quality - Excellent. No fishy smell on my food or in the restaurant. Delicious. Rolls were well made and tasty! - Quantity - I walked out STUFFED from eating the $9.99 lunch special. - Price - Can't beat $10 for lunch, especially this much good sushi.  But the takeout side of things was not as good. The teeny tiny salad had wilted lettuce. The takeout version of the Sakana lunch does not include miso soup, although the price is the same, and they did not include chopsticks, napkins, or soy sauce."
"I could write a review entirely refuting the poor reviews that HuHot has received on Yelp thus far. Instead, I'll focus on what I perceived to be an entirely fun and delicious dining experience.   To start, our waitress brought it to our attention that it was $1 Corona night. Not only that, but HuHot has a pretty decent selection of beers. Win.   As part of your meal, you get your choice of fried rice, white rice, or warm tortillas. Another addition to the all-you-can-eat meal was egg drop soup, which was very tasty.   We ordered crab rangoons for our appetizer - which the waitress said were made in-house - and they were pretty great. Enough so that I was a little bummed that there were only four rangoons to eat between the three of us.   A unique selection of meat, veggies, and noodles makes up the main course. There are recipe cards at your table and as you approach the bar to help you make a decent little dish. If you trust your inner instincts as a cook, you'll do just fine without the cards when it comes to these areas.   Mind your sauces though. This is where things get a little tricky and can really make-or-break your dish. If you don't know your sauces, go with the cards. If you insist on winging it, there is a heat meter above the sauce area to help make sure your food isn't TuHot.   Besides that corny joke, what's there really to complain about here? Our limes were a little on the old side on our first round of Coronas. The mushrooms were running a little low both times I ran through the line. The jalapenos were hotter than Hades.  Minor.  This was an enjoyable experience through and through.  Oh, and you get to watch your cooks try to do tricks with spatulas. What more can you possibly ask for?   This was my second time at HuHot, and I'll be back for more."
"We came here one evening.  We were starving and not feeling like cooking.  I was pretty happy with my food.  I ordered from the menu that's above the cashier.  I can't complain about the portion size, it was a massive box of rice and 2 big meat kebob things.  I'm glad I read Bilal's review, because I asked about the white sauce and they gave it to me.  Also it was $9.99 + tax or something crazy.  I was stuffed!  I wish I could remember what it was called, but I think it was the second from the right and it started with an ""S"".  (I clearly should have taken a picture) or the menu.  One thing...they said it would be ready in 10 minutes, it took like 20.  I think they think it takes 10 but it doesn't."
"Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. I have been to many hibachis and the menu here was extensive. Not just steak shrimp chicken. They hadn't swordfish, shark, and other exotic stuff. Lots of food. I was stuffed on my $23 swordfish."
"I am currently finishing up an incredible meal. Literally still in the restaurant, but I can't wait to post this. Not because of the food (though that was delish), but because of our server, Clenard.  We came in, sat for maybe ten minutes, when he came over, profusely apologized for our wait, and informed us he'd be getting us bruschetta on the house. Then, as we proceeded to order, he was incredibly attentive and helpful. My friend got around four Arnold palmers, and he kept them coming!! He was cordial, kind and incredibly professional. Then we also received dessert on the house (for a wait that, honestly, was NOT bad). Everyone was wonderful, and I'm sure clenard is a reflection of the entire staff and restaurant.   Because of this amazing server (and, not to forget, an awesome meal of the lamb meatballs and artichoke heart salad) I am set on being a regular here.  I've never leave reviews but because of the quality of service and meal, I must. Thank you!"
The breakfast at egg works was amazing and they serve big portions! The potatoes were my favorite and the french toast was excellent! Definitely will be back!
"Fantastic dishes and service.  The chicken quesadilla may have been the best I've ever had.  If and when I come back to Vegas, I will be back."
"Harlow's serves up a simple, thin crust pizza that gives you that real authentic Italian feel. They have a limited menu (a handful of pizzas and drinks, no substitutions allowed), but you are bound to get a good pie no matter what. My girlfriend and I got 2 pizzas (the margherita and the bianca), ate both, and left feeling satisfied without being stuffed. The pizza has a great, clean taste while staying light and fresh. The interior is just as fun and bright as the pizzas with a New Mexico feel (cacti and animal skulls with peach painted walls) and has a large front window they keep open when the weather is nice. Definitely stop by when you're looking for a nice light pizza."
Service was really poor. May try the King Street one to see if service is better. It was my first time going and I found the waiter serving us rude and ignorant. Will not go back to this restaurant.
"Great dogs, great drinks, great people!  We have stopped by and grabbed something to eat many times. We have also hired them to cater a company picnic. Have always been very accommodating. They have a selection of: Jumbo Dogs, Mini Dogs, Spicy Dogs, Polish Sausages and Brawts! All of it are great!  They are located in the parking lot at Home Depot. There are two benches there if you choose to eat there. Many customers end up eating there while talking to the workers.  Had one today, and will continue to be a regular customer."
"This is good pizza.  I ordered a 12"" Palermo Supreme.  The crust was light and crunchy.  They make their own dough.  I was impressed.  Service was great too.  Friendly staff.  I recommend it!"
"Excellent. Here for some drinks and team building. Mainly drinks.  Then Hank showed up.   We was already drunk.  Instantly started hitting on every woman he saw.  The he yelled, ""check this out!  I'm going to see how many golfballs I can shove in my mouth!""  It was 7.  He shoved 7golfballs in his big mouth."
My girl got the shrimp tacos and enjoyed them alot. They have a wide selection of hot sauces that you can select from yourself. They have fish taco tuesdays! I had a veggie burrito from here a while back and I remember liking it. They have a cool looking tree inside the restautant. The place has a cool vibe to it. So far my experience has been good.
"Hole in the wall?  Basically there was a hole in the wall. I went in. They put me in a booth. Ordered lasagna. Not bad expensive. Not Italy lasagna but worth the price. All you can drink red or white wine l, Salad, garlic bread and Lasagna for $25.95. Not bad. Heck I would do it again."
The food was ok. I like the Miami location better. The atmosphere did not feel young and hip like the Miami location. The fried chicken was pretty tasty.
Ate here last night. Good east side spot. Awesome apps. Gourmet poutine and fois gras terrine were very good. Would have given 5 stars but the steak frites were just ok. Decent wine selection and great service & atmosphere. I would recommend it.
Randomly stopped in with some colleagues. Had the fish and chips and they were awesome. Fish was battered but not too heavy and the fries were nice and crispy.
"Ioana was a wonderful server. Thank you for being so polite.  We are locals and decide to come down and do the ""tourist"" thing and you were amazing. Thanks again, we'll be back."
"Sandwiches are so good! Pastries are a little heavy.  Lots of food with the combo, worth the price :-)"
Such A cute place! I came with a friend for brunch and we completely loved it... I had the skirt stake and it was cooked to perfection... Yummy drinks  we'll definitely be back!
"This place has a dang good Philly - which I should hope, since that's their game.  First time I went in the kid taking my order had no clue what he was doing, writing it down on a scrap of cardboard and severely lacking customer service skills.  But the sandwich came out great (and surprisingly, accurate).  Went in a second time a month or two later, and the gal was friendly and helpful - way better experience than the first time.  Again, the sandwich came out fantastic.    I found the prices to be reasonable as well, especially for a little mom-and-pop shop like this.  Definitely worth the stop, and next time I'm craving a Philly, this is where I'm headed."
"We went for breakfast yesterday.  There was 4 of us and they offer 4 different vegan breakfast choices so we ordered one of each,  We often employ this strategy so we can try different things. The place seems borderline cheesy to me.  The service was over the top good but the quality of food and coffee not so much.  Of everything we tried the French Toast was the best of the lot!  They had some sort of sweet potato hash brown that was undercooked and the coffee was on par with the quality of a convenience store.  Bottom line - gimmicky place with good service, below average food and lousy coffee.  I will not be returning any time soon."
"Another disappointing meal in Vegas :(.  We ordered a variety of dishes: har cherng, sui mai, har gow, cha siu bao, etc. Yuck. Not good at all.. (I forgot to take pictures because we were so hungry that we just dug into the food right away.) It didn't taste fresh, and the dumpling skin wasn't very soft. The sui mai looked OLD. I eat dim sum quite frequently and this was nowhere near the standards for dim sum in LA!   The best thing was probably the boiled Chinese broccoli dish (which tastes the same everywhere) and cha siu bao (but I've still had better). Gr.. Eating such horrible dim sum just made me crave better Chinese food in LA.   Service: It was difficult to find a server to refill our drinks and give us our check. However, the workers are friendly and   Note: It's located inside Gold Coast Casino. Some advice? Come early! This place isn't too big and there was a line when we arrived around 12:30pm until we left the restaurant a little before 2."
had to listen to this yeehaw cringe birthday song 3 times in 1 hour. trees trees trees
"The service is good for a very busy Chinese restaurant. They gave you a lot of food for the price. All the food item we ordered are above average. I love the fact that they have revolving door, so that the cold does not come in when people go in and out; and they also have a large waiting area which is really a life safer when you have to wait for 20 min with the deep freeze outside."
"This was my first time at this restaurant and I was very impressed. This location is inside Mandalay Bay, near the convention center. I came here for brunch with a few friends and they have an unlimited small plates menu for only $35. You can add unlimited mimosas too for $10. Of course, I did the unlimited small plates and mimosas.  I pretty much tried every item on the menu and everything was really good. My favorties were the waffles, breakfast fries, and pigs in a blanket. You might has well order everything off of the menu because it's unlimited! The food comes out as it's made.   The mimosas were really food. They were definitely heavy handed with the champagne. They have a ton of different flavors and seasonal flavors. They have blood orange (my favorite), passion fruit, prickly pear, mango, pomegranate and more! Some of them lacked flavor and just tasted like champagne, but hey, it's unlimited so who cares!   I stayed here for about 3 hours with my friends just eating and drinking. This is now probably one of my favorite brunch spots!"
We were really excited to try their BBQ after seeing it highlighted on DDD. I'm originally from Kansas City and have a love for great BBQ. The drive from Gilbert took about 40 minutes and I was not disappointed. Mike and Bill took care of me and recommended the chopped beef and collard greens. Both were delicious! I've not had collard greens before and really liked them. Looking forward to the next time I visit this excellent restaurant. Thank you for taking care of me.
"So delicious, all the sauces were so thick and flavorful! Great amount of food for price. And the sit down service was awesome. They even gave us an extra cup of soup and crispy noodles for free for our kids. Love it, we will back."
Interesting that this place closed. The one in Jersey where I lived was packed at all times. I can say perhaps it was the youngsters working here with the attitude of not wanting to serve. Walked in and was the only person there and I could see that I was clearly an annoyance. Not just the waitress but even the person behind the counter -I suppose he was the cook? Food was ok but customer Service is probably what caused this location to close.
"Seriously, the best restaurant I've been to in awhile. My friends had the fried chicken and said it was amazing. I tried the mac and cheese, simply amazing. We're going back before we leave Las Vegas."
First time here and am truly impressed with how good the hamburger was. I like the locations decor and good ol rock and roll background music. Will come again!
Nothing like paying $10+ for a container of curly fry bits and pieces and a sandwich where the bun is actually more greasy that the bacon that was on it.
"I personally think you can find better roti in the city. The last time I was there I got the Jamaican pumpkin roti. I felt as though they didn't put enough filling in it and was all roti. The BBQ tofu dish is pretty good. I'm not sure where else you can get bbq tofu like that in the city hence why I am giving them a 3 stars.  If it wasn't for the BBQ tofu I think I'd give it a 2.5 it's not really because of the food but sometimes when I go in the i find the costumer service a bit poor. I also sat down and ate there rather then take it to go asked if I could have a cup of water and they told me they can't give out cups. . I also really didn't like that.  Would I go back there again, maybe it's defiantly not the first thing on my list..."
"Saturday night buffet around 9PM.  At 9PM the line to get into the buffet was still pretty insane.  Thank goodness for line pass!  Saturday is their ""gourmet"" buffet and you get some extras like beef wellington (pretty good) and lamb chops.  There are also selections of venison and prime rib but both were incredibly bad and overcooked or RAW, not rare.  I've never seen snow crab at the B buffet so I'm guessing they were new.  They also had the usual king crab legs but both the king and snow were partially frozen and TINY.  I'm sure if our party had gone earlier, we would have been able to get the bigger, more meaty ones but oh well.  For a first timer, the buffet would be good but coming back to eat again would be really difficult to justify the $40+ price tag.  Even on a comp, I would probably prefer to have an enjoyable more peaceful meal at the CAFE!"
I was not impressed and the food was fair and I spend a lot of money. The place was very busy and cold. I will not return soon.
"definitely the best barro's location i've been to!! it's always consistent, clean, pleasant employees with great customer service! they can be crazy busy and still be smiling and attentive. i usually get a veggie pizza, veggie salad or cheesy bread which has all been SUPER bomb! it's nice to go here and watch a football game sometimes to take a break from the busy loud sunday football bars. i miss living in tempe and by this location! no other ones compare."
"I'm not a vegetarian, in fact I'm more of a meat-etarian... But I would recommend this place to those who like to dine vegetarian..  Mom told me a few of her friends recommended this place, so I guess she wanted to go..  Made a RSVP for Friday night, parking was full and place was packed, so we waited 15 minutes.  Sat down and ordered a few dishes which we accustomed to and also ordered some unfamiliar dishes recommend by Yelp users.  Overall the food was very good. Although I'm not into this type of food, I could tell it was pretty well cooked, props to the kitchen!!   Only complaint is the food came pretty slow considering we came later in the evening and by the time we got seated, the place was half empty..  I personally wouldn't come back here for dinner unless if someone wanted to go or if I had to accommodate vegetarian friends - just because I prefer meat and seafood..   But I would come back to try their dim sum dishes, as they look delicious and I have faith in the kitchen.  Even though it's not my cup of tea, I believe this place deserves 4 stars"
"My first visit here was about 2 months ago. I'm not entirely sure when this place opened but I knew it was fairly new. Either way, I ordered the San Francisco Benedict. The atmosphere and everything seemed great. When my food arrived and I took a bite, I realized I had been given the wrong dish as this one was called the Sandi Benedict and had spinach in it. It wasn't a huge deal to me. I really just wanted avocado, so I let the waitress know I had been given the wrong plate. She said she'd fix it and went to the back. I decided to stop eating as I wasn't sure if they were just bringing avocado or if they were bringing a whole plate out. After about 5 minutes of my boyfriend eating and me waiting, a manager came over and asked if everything was okay. I replied that yes as the waitress said she was handling it. Another 5-10 go by and I hadn't heard anything. I was hungry and now my food was cold so I just started eating it. Finally, the waitress comes out and asks if the manager handled my issue. I told her that I told the manager she was handling it. She ran off to figure it out I guess. I ate my cold food and was very unhappy. The manager came over later and apologized and told me that the waitress hit the wrong item on the tablet and they are so busy with trainees that it was chaotic. She gave me a $13 voucher and did not charge me for my meal. She assured me that it isn't normally like that, so I accepted this and planned to return in the future. I would like to mention that the food was good, but the experience wasn't.  I returned just this last Saturday intending to use the voucher and give them go #2. We had a young male server this time. He was nice and polite. I asked him how their herbal tea is (as that is all it was listed as on menu) and he said he hadn't tried it but knows it's some sort of seasonal harvest blend. I agreed to try it. When he brought it and ran off, I noticed he brought me coffee. I waited for him to come back around. I'm really trying at this point to give this place a chance but it was striking out again already. When he finally returned I clarified that I asked for tea, to which he said he thought I asked for coffee and he said he'd bring the tea. When the tea came, the water in the pot was basically almost room temperature. It was just lukewarm. I was sort of done trying so I just lived with it. I ordered the same thing I intended to have the last time. When the food finally came, my hash browns were nice and hot, but the eggs were again room temperature. Not even the slightest bit warm. I didn't complain. I just ate my cold food and made the decision I won't be returning any time soon. Again, the food is good (Should be at least warm) but my experiences here have not been the best. Maybe I'll give this place a year or so to get things together before returning. I've never been anywhere where I have had back to back not so great experiences. I gave it 2 stars for the food being okay alone."
I don't get the allure of this place. Average food and somewhat overpriced. Service good but not great. Many better restaurant choices in the Montrose area for sure!
"Great hookah, delicious food ( we tried the chicken Kabob and freshly made bread) , very friendly staff. I will definitely go back when I visit Vegas in the future ."
My husband ordered a tuna sandwich which was a little on the dry side and the portion could have been bigger with regards to the filling of tuna itself.  Onion soup was fantastic and the cheese was authentic.  I didn't like the cheese melt as there could have been more cheese and avocado was green/bitter.  It's really spicy.  Fries were great. Service is excellent and I'm prepared to give it a few more tries.
"Excellent service and extremely rich tasting food, Guy has taken sports bar food to a new level of decadence. I had the Triple T fries and 14-hour Brisket sandwich. The meal was heavily portioned. The truffle oil laden fries were topped with minced garlic, cheese, and cilantro. The brisket was fall apart tender on top of Texas toast, abundantly garnished with cabbage. The mixed fries accompanying the brisket were like hot thick BBQ chips, delicious. Ashley made our experience perfect, attending to our wants and needs, making great suggestions, and patient. My suggestions though are to order margaritas or the ginger mint cocktail to temper the creamy robust and overwhelming at times. Please share because the tastes are to strong to eat the same dish for 30 minutes, mix it up and prepare for large portions."
Worst food experience ever.  Avoid this place and spend your hard earned money somewhere else.
I've waited so long in the drive thru line and the worst thing is there was no one even in front of me I've waited 15 minutes just to order my food at the drive thru....and the food tasted like crap.
"I don't give too many onesies and twosies, but I believe this place merits it on one main level that trumps the modern high ceilings, giant photos of good looking sushi and the staff who get something for effort.   The real issue here on two specific occasions is this; I was attracted by all the ads and photos of their somewhat new Temari offering. It stands for ""hand ball"" or the like and are rice balls either stuffed, mixed or topped with various ingredient combinations.   In sum it adds up to this; too expensive for the lack of quality ingredients in the 4 balls themselves. The photos are quite misleading and in the case of the crispy lobster balls is virtually faux...where's the beef comes to mind...pretty much lobster rillettes at best.   I think you can read between my overt lines that I was really disappointed times two."
"We waited twenty minutes and never got served... they sat us down in a booth, and we saw them look at us a couple of times but no one came to our section. We really wanted to try it out but no one even asked us for drinks, this place was almost completely empty . We won't be coming back."
"Nice service, reasonable prices, and better/more interesting flavour than the average TO Indian food restaurant.  Was hesitant to try a roti place because I cannot eat wheat; however, they were more than happy to accommodate.    Not a place to take a first date, because the decor is a bit boring."
Too bad I can't give 0 stars... It should not take over 30 mins to get food from a fast food joint. The service is incredible unprofessional and the place is Unorganized. Avoid avoid avoid unless u wanna waste 40 mins of Ur life away being ignored and waiting for cold food.
"This is the best Chinese Restaurant in Summerlin. The Dim Sum is made fresh on demand. However the menu has all of the traditional Chinese dishes. You must go and try the Dim Sum, Shrimp fried rice, Mongolian Beef, Eggplant, vegetable egg rolls, etc Great service and Outstanding fresh ingredients = a great dining experience  I have to add to this review. Everything is fresh and delicious. You can carry out or eat in. You must try this restaurant"
"Great pub with a wonderful craft beer selection and food.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Also, you can watch App State games here and save the time of driving up to Boone, or elswhere.  Looking forward to attending one of their beer dinners soon."
"I have to start this by saying my first trip to Doan's was 3.5/4 star material - slow service but friendly, I enjoyed a delicious veg/tofu pho (in a beef broth) and my dining companion ordered a bun with nicely flavored meats and a pretty good spring roll on top - but my second visit made me wonder.  I was out with my sister when we realized we were hungry, and were in the mood to have a beer or glass or wine with dinner, I couldn't remember if Doan's was serving yet so I called while on the road and a woman informed me they do sell beer and wine, but not liquor. Worked for us. My sister is also a vegetarian and although I couldn't remember if I saw a veg section in the menu, we did find one online so we figured we were safe, and then we arrived... First, our waitress informed us they don't serve alcohol yet. Um, okay? After a ridiculous wait to get someones attention to ask if they had a veg menu supplement, we were informed by a waiter that they used to, but have since chucked it. Great. Unfortunately he was unwilling to point us in any direction or give us any veg friendly options. Okay, back to the menu.  I ordered the rocket shrimp and the bun with chik/pork/springrolls (after they informed me they don't serve the banh xeo listed on their menu). My sister ended up ordering the wonton soup with tofu/veg and the tofu/veg pad thai. My food was fine, but for her, she ended up with a plain wonton soup and the seafood pad thai. If it hadn't taken so long to get the first round of food she would have sent it back, and the waitress was very grateful she didn't want to send it back and that she agreed to pick around the seafood and eat the dish. My sister then asked for a few steamed veggies on the sides to supplement the lack of vegetables in her pad thai, the waitress agreed without issue.   Everything seemed okay, though the veggies arrived in a completely different sauce, but when we got the bill I was a little surprised. Not only did we have to pay for the seafood pad thai that we clearly did not order (and all the seafood was left stacked on the side of the plate), we also had to pay for the side of vegetables! seriously?? It was only a few dollars more in the end, but included with the lack of service (in a fairly empty restaurant), there are just better places in town to get great tasting Vietnamese food with better service. Sorry Doan's, maybe next time."
"We were fans of Flat Top but now like this better because you don't have to wait so long for your food.  You have to stand there while they cook it but for some reason this seems faster than sitting at your table.  They have a wider variety of food and meat than Flat Top also and because they have the two sides of the buffet open with the same choices, you don't feel as rushed with people crowding you.  The kids love it.  We like to get the tortillas and they are a little slow bringing those - they give you only 3 at a time and when the whole group is using them, they don't go very far.    HuHot is really a bargain for kids - I think that it's $5 for all you can eat.  Oh, that's another benefit - you can go up and get more at any time."
"Great noodle spot! I love the vibe and friendly service. I forgot what the dish is called but I got the beef with vegetables and noodles. It was amazing, after a long day at work and you feeling asian food come here. Decent wait time for food, knowing that it's freshly made noodles made the wait worth it. My dish also came a little soup which was a good pairing. I tried the soup my acquaintance ordered and found it quite salty which was weird because it looked like the same broth that came with my dish. Maybe it was the meat? The environment itself was ok, when it gets busy it's super cramped. I found the main wooden soup spoon way too big for my mouth. I think that spoon was made for Matt Stonie or Kobayashi. Overall good food, good service!"
"Great food, service, and ambiance! Cool during the day or night. Definitely recommended!"
Amazing tacos! Loved the taco chiwas! Would highly recommend. Great customer service too.
We went here for Mother's Day brunch. It was a great experience. Not very crowded. We got complimentary flowers. The staff was friendly and the buffet was really good. Overall a good experience. Plus it is close to my parents house. They lack restaurants in this area so I hope this one stays open.
"Had brunch here with my best friend, had been looking for a weekly bottomless spot for a while and this did not disappoint! Amazing scenery and our waitress Nicole was amazing. Super attentive and sweet, made the entire experience worth while. Will definitely come back and hope she is working!"
"Very much a ""diner,"" but good good food. Can't wait to sit on the patio in the spring."
"Ok this place is now officially one of my favorite spots in town. Authentic, fast, clean, delicious, affordable and relatively healthy. It's the type joint you're proud to take out of towners to show off Phoenix cuisine."
"Excellent hotel rooms and great service. The signage is a little confusing since there are multiple routes to all areas of the hotel and casino, but there are always security guards and hotel staff around to ask for directions. Great security as well for hotel guests."
"I'm in love with their vegan pizza...soy sausage, BBQ sauce, and red onions, oh my! My only complaint is the crust...it's not great...sometimes I think it tastes like cardboard (that's why 4 stars and not 5). The toppings definitely make up for it though. I'm not sure what the crust is missing, but I wish it was better (or maybe not because then I'd be ordering pizza more often!!).  We have never been there in person--always gotten delivery. The delivery is fast...usually around 45 minutes. Once they forgot my soy sausage and the replacement pizza was here in 20 minutes. Great service!"
"This place is my neighborhood go to for Thai. I've always enjoyed the dinner food over several years, both in restaurant and delivery. I tried their mango smoothie for the first time the other day and I found a new favorite place for those now too. Yay!"
"Good flavor, fast delivery, everything is HOT when it gets here!  Order all the time and have never had a bad experience.  My favorite is the Wonton Soup and House Chow Fun, but don't forget the Crab Rangoon!"
"This place is a Quebec chain. The restos are conveniently located, large enough to generally accommodate you whenever you show up. Large plastic menu in the style of American chains, but in French and with an emphasis on foods we dig here in Quebec like moules et frites and smoked meat. The food is average, but if you go for beers and fries during 5a7 you're likely to leave feeling buoyant and ok with your life choices. It's called joie de vivre =)"
"First time here and the menu is a little overwhelming with so many options! Loved the food, okay coffee, great service. Will definitely be back."
"I'm an In-N-Out lover, but the reason I took the time to rate this location was because the service was stellar. Most locations are friendly but this loc the staff went above and beyond. Clean, too!"
I am not a BBQ connoisseur but I have eaten at many BBQ places. This is as good as it gets for me. Hands down the best I have ever had in my opinion. The best brisket if you can get some before they run out.
"This restaurant definitely lives up to the hype and if you asked me one restaurant you should go to in Vegas this would be it. I had heard of the restaurant before on my travels to Montreal, but never got around to it. Montreal for the record is a foodie wonderland.   Although this restaurant is priced high, in Vegas terms I would say it's average. The service, ambiance and location are exceptional and the food couldn't be more perfect. I usually have some sort of critique on what could be better, and this time all I can say is that if they could make the meal never end.   The best way to experience Milos is via their tasting menu. I started with their grilled octopus which is one of the best I've had (other than in Montreal of course). The flavor and texture of their octopus is just right and the portion perfect.   For my main I went with the lobster pasta, which was equally delicious as my starter and equally well executed. If I could eat this dish every day, I would.   Dessert was a baklava walnut cake topped with honey ice cream. Delicious and a perfect ending.   I can see why this restaurant is considered one of the best Mediterranean ones in the world - with locations in London, Athens, New York, Miami, Las Vegas and Montreal."
Really great little lunch spot. The BLT is wonderful. Nice atmosphere and good prices.
"Ru sans turned out to be a chain that exists in a few cities around the country. It's not great but it's not bad either.   There are a number of creative sushi rolls that exist on the menu and have a decent selection of vegan/vegetarian options as well.   We have been here a few times which just shows that the food is good but don't expect it to blow your socks off. If you're looking for a place that serves tasty sushi, has a fun environment this is a good place to check out. But service at times has been slow."
Do not eat the GF crust if you have Celiac!!! It's definitely not GF. I usually can deal with a little bit of unavoidable contamination but by my reaction their crust DOES actually contain gluten. Be careful. It's also very pricey given the quality of the actual pizza. Definitely a big NO-NO.
"Modified my previous review after the store owner's thoughtful response to feedback shared. I respect small business owners that put in effort to follow up to feedback shared. After his note, I have gone back to the business and better understand what their focus areas are.   SUMMARY Cheese & Crackers primarily is an order ahead market. The name 'cheese and crackers' is misleading, as what they offer stretches beyond cheese. You can order a range of things like artisanal cheese trays, cured meats to seafood. The trick is to visit their website and sign up for their mailing list. There, you'll get a better feel for the range of products Cheese & Crackers offers on a weekly basis beyond what you just see in-store.   PROS: - Order Seafood: They have a mailing list to order fresh seafood. Sign up on their website. They bring in fresh, high quality seafood from Canada. I went to a dinner party that served fresh salmon from here - was delightful.  - Catering: They are a great fit for catering, in particular artisanal cheese platters and trays.  - Baguette Sandwiches To Go: They serve sandwiches on baguettes like thinly sliced roast beef. - Cheese Assortment: They have an extensive list of featured cheeses.  CONS:  - They don't offer in-store or to-go cheese plates - only order ahead. I would love to be able to stop by, select 3-4 cheeses, take them home to try that evening.  - They have a few bistro tables, but the store footprint is small thus it isn't really a spot to hang out in-store.  - The sandwiches are only served on baguettes, and the baguettes are really tough on your teeth / hard to bite. Would be nice to offer another bread option for sandwiches, as the sandwiches are very tasty."
"I stopped in here the other night before a movie, without having done any research or prior yelping, which is very unusual and risky for me! The menu is vast, and prices pretty decent for the area, selection, and ambiance. I had the drunken noodles with beef and a HUGE portion was delivered. Tender wide rice noodles arranged on a bed of fresh veggies, wood ear mushrooms, lettuce, and flavorful beef. Around $13 w/ tax + tip I believe, quite the bargain and provided me with leftovers! Would go back if I was in the area."
"Good flavors, good entrees.  Sometimes it's not entirely clear which style a dish is going to be in, which can lead to interesting mishmashes.  Friendly service.  9/10 ... Given what it is."
Cool looking spot inside.  Food is good. Price is right! The French Toast was delicious.
"Oh boy. I love giving proactive reviews but this place has made that hard. Sadly I live nearby writhing in pain having to be so honest. Premium pricing with poor execution. The good - prosecco cold, server kind and considerate. The bad - bills couldn't be separated, pasta with seafood was strangely citrus and unItalian. Pizzas bland, calamari average with a strange paste base. Server did not know menu items to recommend.   Overall - the place has a great setting and almost everyone we know including us find it has been consistently poor value for what you pay.   Needs help."
Good eats and good peeps! The Reuben was awesome and the service was great. Better than the big chain bagel places for sure!
Ok so last time I went they nailed all the dishes-except maybe that weird parmigiano-sour chicken wing dish- not a fan but I was very impressed especially since the last two visits food was uneventful- I think they got new kitchen crew so that's a good thing now
"This place creates excellent food. I have been here a handful of times and have no complaints. The meatballs are homemade, you can taste it. The bread is fresh and the customer service is amazing.  I would recommend this place to anyone!!!"
"Alvin, the manager, what a word I can't say. Arrogant, unprofessional, and ignorant. I ordered from grub hub and online they have spicy garlic listed as a dry rub. It came as a sauce. When I asked him the difference between a rub and a sauce he said I'm not going to answer any questions. Alvin stated this was grub hubs mistake even though they are a third party delivery service. He also changed the name of the smart mouthed hostess from Sabrina to brandy. I was advised to contact grub hub in regards to the confusion. Alvin was also rude to that employee stating he would not be doing anything to address the misconception. I was not looking for a freebie. I wanted them to correct their misleading menu. Will be going to corporate asap...never going to hooters again."
I was shocked that a half of southwest chicken salad was $6.00. I realize at the airport you typically pay more but I found this a big rip off.  Not to mention it was not big at all. It was worth perhaps $4.00 total
These posers don't allow dogs on their patio. Way to turn away customers! Suck it nerds!!
"I need to begin this review by stating: I hate Brussel sprouts.  As a child, my father would serve them to my brothers and I, but we did whatever we could to avoid them... hunger strikes at the dinner table, temper-tantrums, or simply slipping them into a napkin and pretend to have finished our meal.    As I grew older, I was open to trying them again since my taste buds evolved to enjoy vegetables like broccoli and beets.  Unfortunately, Brussel sprouts left me wanting to scrub my tongue with a toothbrush and mouthwash in order to rid my mouth of the flavor.  When ordering at Dorothy 6, I saw that Brussel sprouts were serves as a side to most dishes.  My burger came with fries, but my boyfriend's meal came with a side of Brussel sprouts.  My burger was simply perfect - juicy, pink, and filled with flavor.  I couldn't have asked for anything better.  Perhaps that's what made me feel adventurous... I grabbed my fork and sampled my boyfriend's Brussel sprouts... I was in love!  How could this be?  My entire life I have despised Brussel sprouts.  The thought of them would make me gag in horror.  Now after trying the sprouts served at Dorothy 6, I crave them!  Where have they been all my life?!    I would go back to Dorothy 6 Blast Furnace Cafe for many reasons: great beer, amazing burgers, pierogis... Now Brussel sprouts are added to that list.  Thank you, Dorothy 6 for changing my mind and mouth about Brussel sprouts."
"The food was good but overall I would suggest finding somewhere else. The service was a little slow, the food was alright but not amazing (and we are in Phoenix, don't settle for mediocre). It felt like a chain restaurant.  On the upside, it might be good for large groups."
"This place is garbage now and it upsets me because it used to be my favorite place in town to get a good pizza. The new owners lowered the quality and taste of the pizza, they even use canned sauce and frozen dough unlike the previous owners who would make their sauce. I never write reviews but this needed to be said. How much do I have to pay to get the old owners and pizza back!"
"Had an egglslut and a gaucho... pretty good for brunch but not enough to fill.  Also had to wait in line for 30 minutes-- should've gotten there earlier, oh well!  A good mid morning snack."
"The best Yucatan Pork (aka cochinita pibil) I have ever had! It was so tender and full of flavor, it melts in your mouth! Order it with corn tortillas and makes excellent tacos! One word, YUMMY!"
I love Marie Callender's and this one didn't disappoint me.  The service was very quick and super friendly.   The food is great and the portions are good.   Eating here is always a good value and here it was a good experience.
I was expecting a lot more for what they charge. The buffet wasn't any better than others on the strip. Station casinos still give you the most bang for your buck. If ambience ID what your after than this is your place
"My review is very similar to that of Casey Lyn B: I am American, have rarely had poutine, and this is the only poutine place I've ever been to in Canada. It is, in fact, the only restaurant I have ever been to in Canada (went during a 6-hr Toronto layover), but the bacon+chive poutine was just perfect and everything I wanted. I liked all the components: the fries themselves, the gravy, the cheese curds, and the bacon (it was NOT Canadian bacon but American bacon bits). The name might make it seem like a tourist trap but from looking at the setup, I think it's meant for drunks hungry at 2am. If I lived in Toronto and was drunk at 2am, I would DEFINITELY seek this place out, but I also recommend it to sober tourists on a layover!"
"I was looking forward to trying Darbar restaurant. Went there for lunch few days ago for the first time. We were greeted and welcomed. Then I asked for some water but was brought bottle water and was told that ""the tap water was not healthy due to construction""! Really?! That was the weirdest thing I had ever heard!  We were brought some bread which was not very impressive compared to North restaurant or Gilaneh restaurant that bring hot freshly made delicious bread! Then looking at the menu, the first thing I noticed was the high prices, which I think was the highest I had ever seen in a Persian restaurant. Looks like the prices have gone up about 1.5 times since it was opened 2 years ago, based on the menu I found online. To be fair, the portion was big and 2 people with average appetite can share it. I had Soltani kebab and the quality was very good. I just think that at least for lunch the prices need to be more reasonable. They could make the portions less I guess and bring the price down too. Overall I am happy I tried it but don't think I will go there too often."
"If I had to describe this place in one word, it would be 'meh'. This place is surrounded by big commercial buildings, and I would think this  would be a good place for lunch for the employees. Also there's not many other pho places around here so I see why this place would get a lot of business. Came here craving for pho, I left kinda half satisfied. The broth was a bit too light for me, the portions were quite average, they didn't have culantro with their complimentary veggies nor my fav pickled hot peppers. The condensed milk coffee wasn't filtered properly so I had to avoid drinking all the way to the bottom of the cup. 6.5/10"
"This pizza seriously reminds me of Pizza Hut.  I thought it while I was eating it, and then when I brought extras to work the next day, my coworkers were all ""who got Pizza Hut!?""  It has that nostalgic taste, that buttery pan-crust, that takes you back to your childhood of ordering from chain pizza restaurants.    I didn't pay for it, but apparently it's extremely cheap.  And thus - really popular!  We stopped in on a Tuesday night, and I believe it was $6 for unlimited toppings on a ""large pizza"" which is really a smallish medium pizza at any other place, but whatever.  They can call it what they like.  There was a LONG line of people waiting to pick up their order, so clearly Pizza Bogo has hit a niche with the public.  It was good - tasty, crispy crust, decent toppings, but it's not worth freaking out over.  ""Best Gourmet Pizza in America?""  Furreal?  Says who?  I've had way better pizza, all over the country, but I will admit for the price and the convenience (and the nostalgic Pizza Hut esque taste), it's a good deal.  I'd say it's good for the days when you just want to get a couple of boxes of good pizza to eat during a game or something."
"So my Wife and I along with my son stopped in for two meals while we were staying at the Linq Hotel.  Dinner.  We all had a great Time the service was great the food was great, Wife and I both had the Cesar Salad I added Chicken the wife did not.  I added a wing order plain with both sauces on the side,  another great choice! My son ordered the volcano fries I believe.  They were a little spicy for him but I had one and they were also very good.    Experience #1 ""4 Stars""  Breakfast the next Morning:  Being we had such a good experience the night before we decided we should try breakfast.  WOW did things change.  The only part of this experience that was favorable was the Hostesses!  They met you without delay and were extremely polite.  From Mount Everest to Death Valley from there.  We sat down and waited a while for our server ""Eric"" to arrive.  When he did he looked alike he had just gotten out of bed, and acted like we were wasting his time.  We ordered three things.    1.  Steak and Eggs which definitely missed their stop on Flavor Town, Extremely Bland!  Cooked well but again very bland.    2.  Chilaquiles.  Looked like it sat under a heat lamp too long and again other that the carne Asada which did taste ok we were not a fan.  3.  Chicken fried Bacon biscuits and Gravy.  The gravy was obviously prepared by someone different the the cook that prepared the Bacon which was just above Raw.  Remember the Gravy?  Outstanding, However that was the only part of the dish that was going to be eaten by my son.  This dish should be changed to just Biscuits and Gravy!    Let me make a note that if it was not for the hostess and the guy bringing by the coffee I would have given breakfast 0 stars. However I am giving breakfast 2 stars for the things that were good.    Also if you read the reviews it is obvious that Guy and his staff have written this place off as a lost cause because I cannot even see where they have replied to any of the reviews they have received.  Good or Bad.  Experience #2. 2 Stars.  Over all we give Guys a very charitable 3 stars.   Lastly the Hash House must be where Guy eats when he is in town.  They waiter stated that he had been there for a while and that Guy doesn't even stop buy when he is in town.    We did try the Hash House A GO Go and it was great. Long wait but well worth it!!!!!!"
"I am going to give it 5 stars cause I want it to succeed. It's a beautiful restaurant and the food was good and the pickles were insane! Try it and support it, after-all the place is legendary!"
"Food was great. Amazing beer selection. Tonight was our first time here and we will definitely be back. The kitchen manager came out and asked us how the food was, and it's just so nice to have that personal touch now."
"Gameplay is fun but horribly disorganized facility.  Bartenders are slow. We could have had 2 drinks before they even took our order.  No reservations taken unless you pay 50 dollars to skip queue, which we only found out late.   Half the bays were open yet we were made to wait 2 and a half hours, after which we left.  Drinks were good, once we got them, food was decent except for the chips, which were disgusting. Like Doritos without flavoring.  Music was awful.  Typical Scottsdale douche baggery, except with no sense of business and lame customer service.  Prices are also on the high end making the experience even worse."
"Well what can I say.  The owners are very nice and try.  I think the wife should do more then seat people.  She could pass food around while the husband cooks diff meats.  They use like four of the same meats but say their different, for example adding garlic sauce on it counts as one.  Wine comes with the Groupon, however if you don't want it, you only get one soda.     I started feeling sick before I left and believe I have food poising.  I've been gone less then 25 mins and been in the bathroom three times already.      The meats are cooked on the grill not like Texas de Brazil when they have all the meats cooking on a rotational cooker.   I would try it.  Spend they extra 10 and go to Texas de Brazil..    I wanted to like this place, I did.. oops back to bathroom!!"
"I loved my pulled pork sandwich. It was very very good ! they have a spicy vinegar sauce, Carolina style which I really appreciate . However I always eat my pulled pork with coleslaw. I ordered Carolina style.... It was horrible! I had a half inch of vinegar floating at the bottom of my cup. Totally turned me off. However there are several other side  dishes. I  know what to not try again, but I certainly will come back here. The barbecue was phenomenal."
"AMAZING!!!! So so so so so good!! My mom, sister, and I stopped in before we saw a show and all loved our orders. I played it a little safe and got the spaghetti, my sister got the lasagna, and my mom got the burrata agnolotti. We all loved our meals and ate every single bite. The sauce for the spaghetti was so rich and flavorful and although I didn't try their selections my sister claimed it was the best lasagna she's ever tried. It is a little pricey but it's so worth it for the quality of the food and the great service. A must try if you're in Vegas!"
"I NEVER eat at Extreme Pita. After a bout of food poisoning many, many years ago...I have been so turned off by it. However, while visiting with my sister over the weekend we figured we should have a quick bite to eat before venturing out on our errands. We stopped in here as it was close by, and I was super impressed! We were greeted with friendly smiles. The place was SPOTLESS, including the bathroom, which I did use. We shared a veggie pita and it was really good, all of the ingredients tasted fresh and delicious. The only downside was the really strong onion smell on my hands after washing them repeatedly! I am happy to say that I am no longer afraid of Extreme Pita =)"
"My boyfriend and I were excited to try this restaurant because it is very close to where we live. We were hungry for a late dinner and ordered some food to go to bring back home. The food was ready in about 15 minutes and everything was great!   We are mostly veggie eaters so we each tried the falafel wrap, which was excellent. The falafel was crispy and warm, grilled with veggies in a pita wrap. The wraps came with a fresh cucumber sauce that we put on the wraps, a great addition. We tried the tabouli, which was also fresh and delicious. We also shared a spinach + feta pie from the appetizer section.   This was a LOT of fresh food for a great price, we will definitely be going back. Highly recommended."
"Sat at the bar and the bar tender introduced me to a new drink that I love! I have never liked beer, but he made me a ""Shandy"" (Stella Beer and Sprite mixed together). I am now a shandy lover."
"We came here twice during our stay.   Why? Because of the beef noodle soup. Tired, hungry, slightly hungover, and wanting something to satisfy the need of something homey that American food cannot, Noodle Asia was the most appropriate dining opportunity. Plus it was just downstairs in the lobby at the Venetian.  Shitty service, but it didn't matter when we got our bowls. The waitress took our orders and requests, but that was it . We had to ask other waitresses."
"We took our grandmother here for a going away dinner before she moved to a different city, sadly it was not what we came to expect from red lobster.  The air conditioner was cranked to the max and it was a chilly day to begin with , so when our food finally arrived it was cold before we got to taste it. We had ordered endless shrimp and after our first round of shrimp we waited for our waiter to return for over 15 minutes , and after we ordered the second shrimp selection they didn't make it to our table for another 20 minutes and after the rest of us had finished our entire meals .  We then asked for the bill and when we finally got it the waiter didn't return to cash us out. We actually had to walk to the front to pay .  We asked the manager to speak about our service and he told us to wait a moment and he would be right back , but never returned .  Service at its finest .... lol"
"Good food, inexpensive prices. Pretty decent amount of different Italian foods that should satisfy most tastes. The restaurant is a little on the noisy side however if you are willing to see past that and have a family, I suggest trying it out. With most (if not all) pasta dishes, you can opt for the 'family size' which is a great way of cutting costs and sharing a meal. Pizza's are gigantic too (made in their wood burning stove).  Not quite on the same level as some places you would find in Little Italy, but for a chain restaurant, it is certainly worthy of 3 stars."
"It was much better before, but I noticed the quality of food was declining while the price of food was increasing. It would be a good idea if try to out compete their competitors who also offer Mediterranean cuisine by atleast lowering the price since the options aren't as many as well as the quality and service."
"I've been to Snug on numerous occasions, and I do enjoy my time when I go! However, I believe that the menu does need an update. For the prices they are serving, and the beautiful location, the food is not on par. The crab cakes are amazing, and I've had my fair share of fish, steak, ahi tuna, good but not amazing.   Come for a good meal and beautiful location, but after being there many times, menu needs an update! I hope the chefs see this! Hope they are not cutting corners."
Large portions. Great bread sticks. Chicken parmesan was top quality.
Everything was just perfect. This is worth the money and our time to drive! Recommend this place to everyone! *drools*
"It was okay. The people were really nice and friendly. My boyfriend and I went together, and I decided just to get rice and naan because I wasn't very hungry, but my boyfriend was quite hungry so he got a dinner. He got the ""tikka"" kabob plate. Each dinner plate comes with naan, salad, and rice.   My boyfriend loved his kabob, and I tried it and it was pretty good. The rice was kind of greasy and there was not much taste. The only thing that made the food different from other middle-east style eateries was the salad dressing which my boyfriend thought tasted like Big Mac sauce, and this other sauce for the meat that he said tasted kind of like salsa (not that it was bad, just saying).  The actual venue was extremely busy; we went at about 8pm on a Saturday night. There was a lot of tables in the restaurant but they were all full. A varied mix of people; families with children, groups of friends, couples... everyone. We decided to get takeout because really hectic restaurants are uncomfortable to me.  I would not go out of my way again for a meal here, but if I happen to be in the area and I am hungry, I would probably go for some naan or something. The people were very  nice, and I like to support nice people! :)"
"After spending the day at Woodbine Beach, I was looking for a good burrito place within decent walking distance to share with friends. Luckily, Burrito Bandidos was not too far a walk, and it certainly did not disappoint.   I ordered a large Mango Chicken burrito, complete with everything, short of jalapenos. I waited around 5 minutes for the order to be completed, which seemed shorter than most of the reviews here. (Although, most of them seem outdated.) The chicken was fairly juicy and tender, and the ingredients tasted fresh. My only complaint would be that the mango chicken was around a dollar more than the regular chicken, and the only thing you got were roughly julienne-d apple mango slices. Nice, tangy addition, but not worth the extra cost in my opinion.   I would drop by again if I was in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to return. 4/5"
"We visited last week.  Be Warned! My husband's sister ordered a cheeseburger.  The waiter asked how she wanted it cooked and explained that ""Medium"" would be pink through-out.  She ordered the burger medium.  It took a very long time for our food to arrive and when it did, her burger was cooked very well done.  The waiter offered to have another burger made.  We had waited quite a while, and everyone was nearly done with their meals, all of us sharing with my sister-in-law whom still had no burger.  The waiter came by and my sister-in-law said to just cancel the order because we had already waited too long for it.  He said that he would take care of it.  A few minutes later, someone who appeared to be a manager came to the table delivering the burger we had already asked to be removed from the order.  My sister in law, frustrated at this point stated ""No, I don't want it now"".  The manager walked away.  A few minutes later I noticed the manager with a waiter standing in the middle of the restaurant pointing at our table and mocking my sister-in-law like a school yard bully.  I very discreetly informed our waiter that I thought it was highly inappropriate for his manager to behave in such a way.  Moments later the manager stormed up to our table and began raising his voice at me and scolding me for my ""perception"" about what had taken place.  He then went on to blame the whole incident on the waiter, who had done nothing wrong.  I won't be back."
Good food we go once a week close to the best in the valley! Really good beef pho also the lemon grass chicken is awesome!!
"I was quite surprised by my visit to Adega. We had a reservation for 8:15 but showed up around 7:30 and they told us our table was waiting for us. Their tables are quite distant from each other, so you can actually listen to what your friends are saying 5 stars so far! After we made our order we got bread and olives, which is typical for Portuguese restaurants I guess. I don't go to too many, so I'm not an expert. Bread was okay, but kind of generic. 3 stars for that Food was another matter. We ordered the appetizer platter and some shrimp on the side. Everything was really good, and tasty. Their portions aren't even small, cause I felt  I was getting full by the time we finished the appetizers. For main dish we all tried something different - seafood and meat. If you go there go for the seafood! My duck breast was tasty, but the portion felt small. My meal was the smallest of all. I didn't leave hungry so it didn't bother me. Overall, I'd say food is really delicious, but not so imaginative. I felt like you can have some of the dishes at other places. 4* here Desert: I ordered the creme caramel and everyone tried it. Everyone got wowed by it! I haven't tried creme caramel in a long time, but it was definitely what you should order if you ever visit 5* on that Service: attentive and polite. Not much else to say. I have no remarks! The waiter was a really nice guy. This could be considered both good and bad, but I felt we had to wait too long to get our main dishes. I didn't care cause we were already having a good time, but for someone who's in a hurry it might be a problem 4.5 stars on service  Tried the Portuguese beer which was nice, but expensive.   To sum it up, while the place might not be exactly 5 stars if I have to be more objective. My score reflects my overall experience from dining in there.  Would I go back again? On a good occasion for sure. This place should also be perfect for a more quiet and romantic dinner!"
"First off, Green Valley Ranch Resort is a hidden gem in the suburbs of Vegas. I am told its part of the 'Station' family.   Dinner. We had an awesome wine recommendation, so perhaps the vino impacted my rating!  They brought out a seafood platter that could have fed an army: oysters, lobster tail, shrimp...unbelievable.   Most of the table ordered steaks, and raved. I was just not in the mood, so I ordered french onion soup and buttermilk fried chicken breast. I never order fried chicken...but the server was correct that it was a hidden jewel on the menu. Moist, and Southern comfort food at its best.   Expect a large bill, but its Vegas, which means no more inexpensive meals.   One more point--there is a 15 foot wide glass double-sided fireplace in the middle of Hanks. Too cool."
"Was dragged here on a Saturday night after a birthday dinner. I knew things were bad even as we approached the entrance. I could hear the music blaring from down the walkway, and when we walked in I felt like I was going deaf. The DJ they had was cranking his levels to obnoxious extremes, and with the sterile decor the sound was bouncing in all the wrong directions. It didn't help that the DJ was terrible to begin with.  The bartenders ranged from jock-like dudes and cleavage-heavy women. All of them seemed slow at their jobs and were too consumed pouring dozens of shots and making fancy drinks to get any of us a simple beer. We drank pints of Kronenbourg, which tasted really off and quite gross.  The washroom situation was one I wish I could have avoided: a bunch of drunk dudes waiting in line and hitting on any woman who happened to be waiting as well. I let a couple girls go ahead of me in order to avoid the onslaught of lame pick-up lines.  The crowd was a mixed bag. My girlfriend said the only people who go here are people who already live in Liberty Village, which makes sense seeing as I don't see why anyone who lives elsewhere in Toronto would specifically make there way here.  We stayed here for about 30 minutes. Terrible in every category."
"Food is basic Italian and comes with all you can drink wine, but it's around 30 bucks per person.  Not worth it..."
"I don't understand the negative reviews for this place, I really like the pho and in terms of customer service I have never had an issue. The best thing about this place is the actual noodles they use. It has a great chewy texture. The broth has good flavour and it is good value. Also the fresh shrimp roll had tons of filling including different herbs. It is on my regular rotation of pho places."
"Had an awesome first time at AZ Top Golf. Big shoutout to Kat our server and Michelle her manager, who kept us very happy with food and drink while a swarm of different events were going on from Make a Wish In-progress to World Series Game 1. We had a minor glitch w one appetizer, but they did everything to make it right and then some! You can definitely trust the staff to take care of you. Would absolutely come back, and makes me wish Top Golf would come to the SF Bay Area!"
"Great place to hang out, such a cute interior! The bingsu is okay. I really like the red bean paste :)"
"Maybe my new favourite Italian place in toronto. Great ambiance, attentive service and delicious Neapolitan style pizza - I had spicy Sicilian. All my friends had pasta and based on sampling all 3 I could've easily had pasta and still gone home happy."
"Maybe it is an Arizona thing, walk into this bar...half the people are wearing plaid the other half look like they are clubbing in skin tight dresses and too much makeup on. The first thing I said to my friend is WHERE IN THE WORLD ARE WE?! Great place for people watching, they had a live country band playing which was cool, but besides that it was an interesting mix of people."
"87 West is awesome!  The decor and fireplace create a hip and cozy atmosphere.  I have been here twice now and everything has been delicious!  My favorite dishes:  the grilled four cheese - so many yummy cheeses and melted perfectly the chorizo flatbread - super delish, perfect combination of toppings the baked brie - love the combination of brie and sweet compote  the carbonara - really good carbonara sauce, my only wish is that it had pancetta instead of chicken an bacon  The wine list and wait staff also added to the awesomeness.  Our waitress was super friendly, nice and good at her job. I will definitely be back soon!"
"If you are headed to a Golden Knights game and you want to chow down before hand, stop here for a great selection of foods and spirits.  Prompt, friendly service and a delicious reasonable priced meal for 3 of us including multiple apps and some drinks along w entrees.  Our waitress Tiffany was awesome and Erin wants to be friends with her.  Overwhelmingly pleasing experience."
"Went to the White Brick Kitchen three times in the past 2 months. Twice for dinner and once for Sunday brunch. Absolutely love this place!   We had the buttermilk half chicken ($17), green beans (special side, changes often. Added $3 on top of chicken) and sloppy joe fries ($14). The portions are really big. I packed a doggy bag from dinner both times. The buttermilk chicken is so crispy and fresh. You can choose to make the chicken spicy for an additional $2. We didn't do that because I'm not into spicy food.  The green beans were baked with cheese on it, which was unique and delicious. The joe fries were really good. They did not skim on the ingredients. A lot of meat! The sunny side up egg was a nice touch. This dish has a kick so beware non-spicy eaters!   The second time I went for dinner, I had the chicken again and a side of cider slaw. The chicken is always good and the slaw wasn't bad. I also had a toffee pudding cake with caramel and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Pretty sweet, but rich and tasty. Good to share with 2 people.   Overall, dinner was great. Only complaint was that the food did take about 20 mins to come both times. I think it's because the chicken was made to order so beware of this if you are on a time constraint. Definitely worth the wait though.   The brunch is only available on Sundays. We had the turkey croissant (special item, changes weekly, I believe. About $14, can't remember exact amount), Scottish eggs ($10) hickory bacon ($4) and homemade ginger beer. Everything was so fresh and flavourful! Loved the brunch here!  The food is on the pricier side, about $25 to $30 a person for dinner and $15 to $20 for brunch, but you pay for what you get here. Totally worth it. Service is okay. Only two waiters working when we went so it was a bit slow, but they were all super friendly! Will be coming back here again! One of my fave American food places for sure!"
The chicken fingers were a bit different for my taste but the pineapple bubble tea with Lychee was amazing!
"We just moved into the area and decided to try the local donut shop. The donuts were tasty and a reasonable side. My Boston cream was okay, but the cream was pretty biased to one side, so it loses a couple points. Verdict: a decent place, but it won't replace our valley favorite of Bosa Donuts."
"We came here on a very hot July 4th. Services were great. The waiter got us ice water immediately. So we ordered two bowls of pho, one bowl of bun bo hue, and an order of spring rolls. The spring rolls were very loosely wrapped, not like the rolls that typically from other Vietnamese restaurant. The pho was good not great. The bun bo hue was very very bland, it was pho broth with a little spice color, not good!!!!"
Handles allergies very well and the food is absolutely delicious.  The service is great too.
"I don't normally review chain places anymore but I'll say this -- this Taco Bell isn't that good as far as Taco Bells go. I don't know why but some ingredients -- especially anything with rice -- tastes awful. I don't know if the Taco Bell/KFC's use a different ingredient base but I can't believe how bad things like the Cheesy Bean and Rice burrito taste. Other than that, it's Taco Bell..what's to say?"
"Since it's called ""Number One,"" I was expecting to be impressed. This was my first experience with pho and if this is indeed number one, pho must be a very overrated food. The beef and pork seemed to be low quality. Most of the restaurant surfaces were covered in grime like one would find above an oven. The floors were sticky all over. The service was friendly but overall the experience was a disappointment. It takes more than an important name to make a restaurant number one."
"Every time I visit Las Vegas, I always stop by some some nachos supreme, they are so gooooood. The hot sauce is also great! The place is a little small and outdated but the service is always pleasant! The Cali burrito and mozzarella sticks are also great! Give this place a try!"
"the location is the only real reason i eat here.  it's the first food option when walking from the Engineering campus to Green Street.  the food is not bad but not spectacular either.  you can basically get anything you want in terms of pasta, pizza, or salad.  the cheesecake factory offerings always look good and i'm happy they are there, but i've never actually eated any of that so can't comment on the quality.  lots of seating makes it less stressful if you are hoping to discuss something important with your lunch companions."
Very tasty food and nice seating arrangements. Only thing is the food can be a bit greasy - but I guess that's a given with nachos/ burgers/fries/etc.
I just tried the Chicken Shawarma and it was AWESOME! Very fresh and the flavors were on point. Great customer service as well! I hope they come back to my neck of the woods soon!!
"Visited this place after seeing people give it 4.5 stars. I would say it is just about average. The owner has paid attention to interiors but if it is supposed to be depict fine dining, bar and lounge then they need to do something more than just hanging the chandelier from the top. It is not a nice view when you look up because I have never been to a fine dining and lounge space that has undone ceiling. Looks very cheap.  Service was good. Food could have been better. Their raspberry ginger mojito was very good. Their pan seared scallops which they claim is one of their signature dishes was overcooked. The presentation although was very good. Their zucchini fries were average with no salt.  Their spicy seafood pasta which again they claim is one of their signature dishes was average. Pasta was overcooked.  They had some mussels and tiny shrimps for the sake of calling it seafood pasta. Restaurants like this should not cut corners in preparing food like this. We didn' t like their cheap cheese grater. I have better ones at home. Their creme brulee was a disaster. Looks like the chef made no efforts to serve it fresh. It had an overdose of vanilla essence. The caramelized sugar coating was cold, thick and extremely sweet. The caramelization part is supposed to be done just before serving.  Little did we know they serve it pre made. Very disappointing.   We have been to some of the best food places all over the country. So when it comes to restaurants we pay attention to many details. The place failed to sparkle for us last night."
"Used to love this place but lately they've been cheapen out on their promotions and sizes of their wontons and fish balls. This kind of irritates me because Jim Chai Kee is supposed to be a famous place that does have a lot of regulars eating there. By doing this, it does not only show how cheap the owner is but how much they don't appreciate their clients (especially the regulars)."
