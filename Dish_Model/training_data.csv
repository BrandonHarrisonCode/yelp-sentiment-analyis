And gastropubs really let me do both at the same time very well. So they're already on a good footing with me.  Gaspar is a very nice place inside. It has a cozy, warm feeling, with its dim (but not too dim) interior, exposed brick and wood. Tip: you can get in either on Rue de la Commune or Rue Saint Paul, or through the hotel to which it is attached.  Both times I came I sat at the bar, and received excellent and friendly service. The first time it was Monday evening, and it was dead (and late November...and cold outside). I had the (BBQ Bourbon Bacon) Burger (that's a lot of Bs). While it was cooked more than I'd have liked (I wasn't asked how I wanted it done, and didn't think to specify...stupid me!) it still tasted very good. Cooked a bit less it could be a top 20 burger for me. I also subbed fries out for cheesy mashed taters (no extra charge) and they were yummy too. Oh, and I had a pint of beer, which was beery good.  Second visit, Thursday night and the place was much more hopping. There was live music, drink specials and a generally good vibe in the place. I had steak frites, which was cooked to the medium I specified (I was asked this time) and good, though not exceptional. The fries (aka frites) were very good. The highlight of the meal, believe it or not, was the pea soup which was so good I almost licked the bowl when I finished! You can bet I'll be ordering that again next time I'm there. Oh, and I had a house beer or two ($6/pint).  You can bet I'll be back (probably very soon)!","burger,steak frites,fries (aka frites)"

Now I live in the Arcadia area so this is the one we frequent. I haven't noticed a huge difference between the two locations, same great food, same stoned servers.  My usual is the Portabello burger. The balsamic marinade they use is fantastic. The presentation is a little messy, but once it hits your lips it's so good.  I pass on the new potatoes for steamed spinach and it's pretty amazing.  Everyone knows the hummus rocks. I love how they let you split up a small order between the roasted bell pepper and jalapeno cilantro. It's like a little hummus sampler for less than $5.  The service can be spotty, especially when it comes to drink refills, but I've surprisingly never had an order come out incorrectly. I normally would not be surprised by this standard service expectation being consistently fulfilled, but I have had some BAKED servers here, so the fact that they can remember my steamed spinach substitution each and every time is kind of impressive. So, good job, stoned servers. Maybe work on the drink thing, though.","Pita ,burger,"

His eyes close a bit, his mouth waters profusely, and he makes that mouthwatering gargling sound.  Do you have the image in your head?  Well, that's probably me exactly when I think about eating at Jimmy's!  It's so delicious that whenever I think about it, I have an instant craving!  The amount of food you get for the price is unbelievable!  The donairs and shawarmas are so big I struggle to finish one.  Even when I'm stuffed to the brim, I can't bring myself to throw any away, so I always make myself sick by force feeding the remaining wrap into my mouth.  I wouldn't for one second dream of wasting a Jimmy donair.  I know that everyone who goes here will all be saying the same thing: it's so delicious and marvelous that nothing else will ever be satisfying again!  The first time I went in here I had no clue what I was doing or what I wanted to eat.  Lucky for me, Jimmy was behind the counter serving people and he pointed me in the right direction of something yummy.  He was super friendly and extremely helpful.  Don't tell Jimmy but I kind of have a little crush on him.  Maybe that's why I keep going back.  Nah, it's because of how fantastic the food is.  Besides the donairs and shawarmas, they also have a bunch of little desserts you can buy.  There is a whole display of baklava and other yummy looking treats.  Along with the food, Jimmy's is also a great place to go if you want to buy some shisha or hookah pipes.  They have a large assortment of different sizes and shapes, and all the flavours that you can imagine smoking.  I seriously love Jimmy's so much.  I miss the days when a friend used to live behind the store and we ate there almost everyday.  Now I have to go a little out of my way to get there, but it's totally worth it every time.  I love Jimmy's so much and I'm positive that everyone who goes there loves it too.  It's just one of those awesome finds that everyone in the world should know about.  *insert Homer Simpson drooling here*","desserts, donairs, shawarmas,baklava,shisha,hookah pipes"

There were these two grouchy ladies dealing with us at the entrance and we have to wait ridiculously long for a table even though the restaurant is almost empty. Then we have to sit as far away from the food as possible. When we ask to sit closer they say no. We ask why and they say no one is covering that area. Seems like they could easily fix that or make one exception, I mean its a buffet. we won't be needing much service if any.   Luckily that lady who took our drink orders was pretty nice and came over often to clear our plates and refill our mimosas.   The food at the buffet was one of the better buffets I've had in Vegas, definitely better than Monte Carlo's or Harrah's, but nothing compared to Paris or Mirage. I was told Caesar's Palace is the best, but I've never had it. From the looks of it, I'm sure its a million times better than this place. If you want a relatively less expensive buffet where most of the food is tasty and there's a fair amount of variety you might want to go here especially for the mimosa's. We got a great deal from tix4tonight. Definitely check out tix4tonight or a service like it before you go anywhere in Vegas.   One really cool feature here is the salad bar, where they make you a salad fresh for you. I really enjoyed the Chinese Chicken Salad. There's also a dessert area that has more choices than a lot of the other buffets, though the execution of them aren't so great.   Definitely worth going to for the food, but I really thought the service was the worst out of all the restaurants I went to in Vegas. For those reasons I probably won't go back, but I wouldn't tell people not to go.","Chinese Chicken Salad"

The waitress gave us tea, which I could taste had red date in it. Fancy!  A simple taro with coconut with tapioca pearls was like $5.25 or something. Basically all the desserts were more than $5. That's crazy! I can literally just make this dessert at home and for a bowl, it would probably cost like $0.50. A few years ago, I think I can still get it for like $3-$4, which is more reasonable, but wow, more than $5 is a little over the top for this dessert. Though I must say, it is Tracy Dessert, and they are a little more on the expensive side.   I also saw other items on the menu like fish balls, chicken wings, shaved ice. My friend got a mango drink with fresh mango in it!   I'm also surprised how many people come to Tracy Dessert after work. We came on a Sunday and the tables were always filled. I think the amount of tables they had were just perfect because no one really waited for seats for a long time, but the tables kept filling up once a table was finished.","fish balls, chicken wings, shaved ice, mango drink"

(See what I did there?)  I already wasn't really thrilled about coming to this joint. I checked the reviews, they weren't really poppin. I looked at pics, weren't enough of them. And the menu looked... okay.  But I'm always down for something new and different and my homie was eager to check this place out, so why not?  Welp, it wasn't good my friend.   I ordered the Packhouse burger; because, if you can't do a burger right, then something is seriously wrong. And it was ALL wrong. Not once but twice.  My other homie decides to get the same thing. She didn't want the tomato jam (she's allergic to tomatoes) and she wanted hers cooked medium well. I wanted the tomato jam and my meat to be cooked medium. You following so far?   We both asked for the Mac and cheese as a side. Side note: why do they not have fries???!!! Not even sweet potato fries???!! Like forreal tho. Anyway, they bring out my homies burger and my other friends dish. They bring out my food last. There's a TON of mustard on my burger. Literally all I can taste is mustard. They killed my meat. Like if the cow wasn't dead before they cooked it, they made sure they killed it when they grilled it. And after a few bites I noticed I didn't have any tomato jam. Come to find out they switched me and my homies Burgers. Although her meat was well done and dry as well. My homie is breaking out (tomato allergy) and I'm just over the burger.   They were nice enough to comp our burgers and asked if we wanted new ones. We were good with that. They also said they would give us free dessert. OKAAAAY!!!  New Burgers come out, they get the toppings right and the chef wasn't as enthusiastic with the mustard the second go round. HOWEVER! My meat was still dry and over cooked. {sigh}.... whatever. I couldn't finish the burger. Like the meat was a choking hazard.   The Mac and cheese was aight. I love Gouda, but it wasn't hittin it. Ah well.  My other homie said her crab cake was too juicy. I didn't get much else from her meal but she did say this place was 2 star worthy as well.   Also we get the complimentary bread and butter AFTER we get our food. The homie has to ask for the bread and butter. Strange and not needed at that point.   The desserts (forgot to take pics) were actually really good. The hummingbird cake was moist and not too sweet. I don't like nuts but I had several bites anyway cause the flavor was really good.   The oatmeal cream pie cookie joint was pretty good but again I'm not a fan of nuts and thick creamy icing. But anyone who is down for this, would love it!   So there you have it.   The service was top notch. I gave more than 20% of what my bill would have been because I can't fault the staff, but I'm sorry guys, the food needs some work.   The location and setup is dope. The vibe is chill and everyone is really attentive and nice. If they work on the food, I can see this place getting packed with the quickness.","packhouse burger, mac and cheese, crab cake, bread and butter, hummingbird cake, oatmeal cream pie,"

It's not a long drive for any local since it's conveniently located near the 215/15.   There are a lot of stores and here and a large variety of store types. I like to come here for work clothing since they have several stores with good prices on dress pants and blouses (Ann Taylor Loft/Van Heusen). The Clark's store is a favorite since that is my primary shoe brand. It's pretty awesome to get a deal on a brand I was already planning to buy. I also love the Harry & David store for gourmet foods.  Look for Starbucks in one of the middle aisles for caffeine. The food options inside are dismal, but there are some okay food options in the parking lot in front of the mall.  This place can get really busy. I find the mall to be pleasant for an hour or two after opening, but just generally miserable after that time. I would recommend planning out which stores you'll visit and setting time limits to get the heck out of Dodge before all hell breaks loose.  The parking lot can be insane. As a local I can say that I hate even driving by here in the middle of the day during my lunch break. Wow, there is a lot happening here. People jaywalking, tourists making crazy lefts onto Warm Springs (just use the LV Blvd. exit!), and just general chaos. I do occasionally come here on my lunch break, but I park in a secret lot to avoid the chaos. No, I'm not telling where that is or how I get there. :)","none"

I'm not sure why he thinks he can refuse service to someone coming in with a service dog, but that was the last straw for me.

My husband had the veal with peppers and said it was so delicious and tender. The mashed potatoes were perfect. I had the salmon Diablo which was also delicious. Our salad was beautiful! Dressing was served on the salad and it was a nice amount. We ended our delicious meal with a piece of tiramisu. Our server Matt was right on!! Very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. Our appetizer, salad and entrees were timed perfectly. I love salad and did not mind that my entree was served while I was still eating it! No problem it let my dinner cool to just the right temp for me to eat it comfortably.  I wonder sometimes if people just don't appreciate relaxing and taking time to eat a wonderful and beautifully prepared meal.  A wonderful atmosphere. So relaxing. The chairs are super comfortable too!!! We will certainly be back.  Give it a try.  Don't  always go by the reviews.  A bottle of Riesling, calamari app, two delicious entrees and dessert for $92!

After we placed our orders, we waited another 5 minutes to get the tea that most places bring with the menu.

I was meeting a friend for a quick, inexpensive and hopefully tasty pre-movie dinner at the Valley Art Theater on Mill.  The decor was what I would call, the ""basic, no frills cafeteria like set up"" that can be found in many Indian and Thai restaurants I have frequented.  Practical and comfortable.  The staff was friendly and welcoming and the menu had typical Indian fare. We shared the appetizers, the garlic Naan and vegetable samosas, both were an enjoyable beginning.  I love eggplant, so my go to order is the Baingan Bharta with rice and that is what I had.  It was delicious, I ordered it mild and it had just the right amount of kick.  I restrained myself from not devouring the whole meal and saved enough to take home for a full meal.  As expected, the meal was a great value of $20 with tip.  Not bad for two healthy meals.  When I am craving Indian and over near Mill, I will return to the Delhi Palace again. Namaste.","garlic naan, vegetable samosas, Baingan Bharta with rice,"

And yes, it's definitely that good. But I've kept coming back because of the drink specials, old school cocktails, the awesome patio, and happy hour food deals.  The happy hour snacks are priced too good to pass up, but honestly, aren't really that special. I think I've ordered the tofu tacos 20 times and I never even really liked them that much, they're just too cheap to pass up. The tofu bites are okay, too, with spicy wing sauces but nothing too special there. The mac n cheese is amazing, like everyone has said, but it is a recipe for a heart attack and doesn't pair well with a night out drinking.  The cocktails, on the other hand, are crazy good. They have a classic menu with old-school drinks that I've never heard of before. A lot of them are knock-your-socks-off strong and unique, and one drink each day is on special, depending on the day of the week.  So I guess what I'm really saying here is, go to Kelly's for a fun atmosphere and grab a couple crazy drinks on the patio with some mac n cheese and sweet potato fries and you won't be broke or disappointed.","mac n cheese, drink specials, old school cocktails, tofu tacos, happy hour food deals, happy hour snacks, tofu bites, spicy wing sauces, cocktails, sweet potato fries"

What can go wrong? A couple of things. First things first, this place is more of a ""rice bowl"" kind of place. I thought it was going to be more diverse as far as the menu goes, but its mainly rice bowls you get with different kinds of meats. The ordering was a little confusing at first, but one of the employees helped us out and I got the 2-item bowl and got the jade chicken and hengrenade chicken with all rice(jerk). I also ordered a jade chicken quesadilla on the side.  I'm gonna admit, this place looks kinda dirty. I don't think Arizona uses those health department letter grade system like California does, but if I were to just judge by how it looked inside, i'd give it a ""C"" grade lol. We waited for about 15 minutes or so and finally got our food. We took it to go and ate at our hotel room.   Mmmm... the food was just alright. The jade chicken was nothing special. It tasted like any generic chinese fast food orange chicken/sesame chicken variant. The hengrenade chicken, although was the less spicier version of the jerk chicken, was still pretty spicy for me. Just be warned the jerk chicken is super spicy. If you aren't sure, ask for a sample at the restaurant before ordering, but it was way too spicy for me.   The jade chicken quesadilla was decent, but nothing special. Just imagine orange chicken in between a tortilla and cheese. A friend of mine ordered a jade chicken burrito and we were confused when we pulled it out of the bag because it was literally the size of Mcdonald's apple pie. If you order the burrito, be warned that it's a burrito for gnomes and smurfs, but he said it was tasty.   They provide a snicker doodle sugar cookie for each meal and it was decent, again nothing special.   Not gonna lie, the next day my stomach felt like a little mexican dude and chinese dude were wrestling and throwing molotov cocktails inside. I used the bathroom like 5 times. I don't recommend eating this place if you have a lot to do the next day.","none"

They use standard bowls to hold the shisha and you get 2 pieces of quick light charcoal.  Being a place that needs to get the customers satisfied, I understand why they use QL's but it will never beat the flavor and duration of a natural wood coal or even compressed coconut shell for burning. I could spend hours discussing their pitfalls and accolades in terms of only their Hookah side of the business but it would most likely just end up sounding drab. So I'll sum it up quick, if you've never smoked a hookah before and want a fairly decent experience, this place will give you a 65-75% good first smoke. If you are someone who is an avid smoker or owns your own pipe, what are you doing out paying for it elsewhere for? You know how it's done, do it up right.   Moving to their food and drink selections. My fiancee and I have tried most of their Juices and found them to be on the whole quite good. Their Oasis Cocktail has some kind of cream that we have yet to identify and I order without most of the time due to the particularly odd flavor it leaves lingering on the tongue.  My fiancee is partial to their strawberry and the banana-honey drinks and orders 2-3 of them at a time if we're there for a long visit.  The hummus was flavored pretty well, and when we ordered a shish-kabob it came out cooked right.  My last visit there I had Shawarma and it was good. Pretty solid foods, drinks, desserts, and hookah. Laid back atmosphere, heaters outside when it gets too cold.

We stayed at the Hermosa Inn, and dinner and breakfast at Lon's were included as part of our package.  We were warmly greeted by the gentleman who was the host upon entering.  Dinner was fantastic - the strip steak was perfectly cooked and flavorful.  Started with the tortilla soup and finished with the panna cotta.  But our favorite part of the meal was the side of truffle fries - wow!  Thought it was great that they had local beer options from McFate Brewing on tap - rare to find them on tap around the valley outside of the brewery.  Our server was very pleasant and helpful, and my wife got a birthday card from the staff since it was her birthday.   We returned for breakfast the next day.  Breakfast menu was considerably smaller and a lot less options, but the food was really good.  I had the ham & cheese omelette, which was great.  Large portion of toast accompanied my omelette, and the crispy potatoes that came with the omelette were really good.    Overall a really great experience - wouldn't hesitate to return for an upscale meal.","soup,"

I was stoked to find out the new one was opening near me. For me, fast food consists of maybe 5 places- and this is one of them.  They serve steak-burgers, so it may cost more than average, but not by much. You can get 2 different styles of burgers: A Freddy's burger that comes with pickle, mustard, and onion. (my preference) Or a California burger. Same meat, but this one comes with lettuce, tomato, onion, and a ""Freddy's sauce"" which is your typical thousand island, fry sauce, spread, etc.  They also offer Chicago style hot dogs, grilled chicken sandwiches, and desserts.  The service is always, without a doubt, amazing. They train the employees well and it shows. Good quality, good prices, and good people.  Do yourself a favor and skip Wendy's, McDonald's, and for sure pass by the Taco Bell next to this place, you won't regret it.","steak burger, Freddy's burger, california burger, chicago style hot dogs, grilled chicken sandwiches,"

This time, I tried lunch and did not have as wonderful of an experience.   I ordered the antipasto to start and it was served in a bowl almost as a salad on greens. It had about 3 very small pieces of Italian sausage, 2 thin slices of prosciutto, just grilled zucchini as far as grilled vegetables and was mostly greens. This was not at all a good value for the money or what I expect when I order antipasto.  I ordered the gnocchi a la Trio for my entree which was an item with a description that sounded amazing. However, the sauce was way too thin and the whole meal was fairly bland. Which is especially odd since it was supposed to be a gorgonzola cream sauce, which I expected to be very flavourful.  On another note, the manager/possible owner who was walking around seemed to run the place with an iron fist and simply not be a very nice person. At one point I heard him chew out a chef about how ""When I say something, that's it. There's no discussion."" Interestingly, he checked in with us mid-meal and was very friendly but his repor with his employees did not put be at ease and I'm less likely to visit a place because of that.  I've rated Trio 3* which is actually pretty generous considering my experience. However, the waiters were very kind and attentive and the dessert was delicious (Tiramisu). That coupled with my original visit mean I'll probably try this place out at least one more time to see if I just caught them on a bad day.","Italian sausage, slices of prosciutto, grilled zucchini"

I came in with my family (Mom and Dad) and they said 10 minute wait, we said okay, we notice that they were short with their staff so we waited patiently till we were seated at a table, but that 10 minutes turned into a 30min wait. So the hostess sat us at a table saying how there may be awhile wait, after seeing 2 servers walk by us like we didn't exist, the hostess later seated another table which were 4 Caucasian customers, we were still patiently waited for around another 30min, when those 4 sat down an Asian waiter quickly came to take their order, I got the waiters attention and said excuse me, we came here first. And she made up an excuse saying how ""Oh we wait on different tables probably your waiter is busy"" I knew this was an excuse, I was so disgusted. So we told the hostess that this waiter is waiting on a table after us, and she said oh well we said there would probably be a long wait, and the hostess had the audacity to say ""Oh but they serve the people who come before"" and I said, we were before them, we been waiting 30min at this table and you know this because you sat us at our table"" she said it depends. So in the end we left the restaurant hungry and went to a much better restaurant which served us very well, called Rice Paper.","none"

(the app made me select one to post) the complete bs I just witnessed as a customer left me with a real stale taste in my mouth. This is the first dine in experience where the stale taste wasn't caused by the food. I went with my family to this location for lunch. The place was busy which is exactly what any good store manager would want; however a good store manager would also want their customers leaving there location feeling respected, valued, & fully satisfied with their dine in experience. Our experience started out great but it slowly showed signs that it was headed down hill when our burgers came to the table before our salads and shakes. We usually frequent the Parmatown location. They seem so much more professional. When our shakes were delivered to the table the chocolate shake made it to the table but the strawberry banana shake was poured into my wifes lap. As you can imagine this feels great in an air conditioned room while wearing shorts. The shake poured straight down my wifes bare leg into her shoe and onto the floor. My wife received a borage of ""I'm sorry!""s which is awesome and conveys how the workers were feeling at the time. The most important question or worry during this situation is #1 How does the customer feel? #2 How can we help them? #3 What can we do to rectify the situation? In retrospect all we received was late food, apologies, wet pants, napkins, and a bill to pay for it all. Yes a bill! The manager came over attempting to offer apologies and a mop. Not once did she offer a solution to rectify my wifes ruined clothes and meal. I as her husband had to speak up and ask for some type of resolution. Some people have the knack to be a store manager while others just don't. This type of manager is what I commonly refer to as a floater. Floaters are managers who do just enough to maintain current numbers and current status quo. They really have no talent or abilities which are beneficial to improving the overall profitability or running of the store. When this location implements points #1,#2, &#3 they will be taking a step in the right direction. It is needless to say that we won't be back anytime soon nor recommending it.","NONE"

First off I'm not a vegetarian but can appreciate a good vegetarian food when I have one and the food at Fresh was VERY bland (yes even for vegetarian food).   I had the dragon bowl with the noodles and the sauce and vegetables and tofu had next to no taste (a little marinade with the grilling would go a long way). There was however some bean wrap (starts with a K) that was pretty tasty but that was pretty much it from the bunch of items we had on the menu.   The place looked alright, but was far too expensive for the sub-par food (my dragon bowl was just $14 for sub-par fast food almost). Not only that but maybe they should've moved the juicer to the back or got someone who knows how to juice considerably haha. The juicer man kept freaking the bejezus out of the whole restaurant everytime he stuck a fruit / vegetable in the juicer and the thing would give out this awful extremely loud noise that would shut the whole place up and it would become awkwardly quiet.  Anyways I give this a 2 stars for expensive sub-par fast food, uninteresting (overdone) design, and food creation tactics. It seems the chain is just trying to catch on to the healthy vegetarian food craze and make as much money as they can while sacrificing originality and good food in the process.","dragon bowl with noodles and sauce and vegetables and tofu, bean wrap"

I don't know if it is different dining in, because I ordered take-out, but it was good.  It didn't blow me away, but it was good.  Very similar to good chinese take-out, or maybe a notch up.  I ordered the Tottie Rolls as a starter.  They are crispy egg rolls that you wrap in a lettuce leaf, with mint and parsley.  They come with a sort-of sweet and sour sauce for dipping that was quite nice.  Or atleast I think that is how you are supposed to eat them?  I had a big take out container full of lettuce, mint and parsley, so I figured that was the drill since I didn't order a salad?  They were good.  I ordered the Tangerine Chicken and the Beef Pad Lard Na.  The chicken dish was good, tasted like an orange chicken, deep fried until crispy then tossed in a sweet tangerine sauce.  It had a few strips of red bell pepper also.  The beef dish I liked a little more, it was the wide egg noodles and had chunks of beef, onion, pea pods and bok choy in a really good brown sauce.  You can order many of the dishes mild to HOT, so I did a medium hot since I sharing the dishes I didn't want to blow them out of the water with too spicy of a dish.  Next time I will definitely go hotter!  The dishes came with 2 containers of sticky white rice, which was exactly what it sounds like. I didn't have any dessert, but the crispy bananas sound great, and I am interested in trying the ice creams I keep hearing about.  I also really want to try the soups, they sound good.    All in all, it was good (I keep saying good!)  the prices are reasonable, and the portions are big.  I have enough for lunch leftovers today.  So, it is worth giving them a try, and I will be back.","lettuce, mint and parsley,lettuce, mint and parsley,Tangerine Chicken and the Beef Pad Lard Na"

Once we were all seated, we were not greeted by anyone for over half an hour, and when someone did come by, we asked whether we could place our orders, to which he said he could not; he's doing something else - so we waited at least another 15 minutes before someone came to finally take our orders.   MAIN: Caprese Salad  The salad was okay - a bit salty for my liking. I personally did not find this dish filling, so I ordered the sweet potato fries as well (See below).  MAIN: Sweet Potato Fries (this was worth it)   These fries were actually very delicious - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. If you visit this restaurant, I would recommend this particular dish, especially given the price ($8) and the portion size (it was quite large - almost the size of a large plate).","Caprese Salad"

I make it out there every six months or so and always talk it up to friends. Tonight I went with my husband and in-laws. We ordered a carafe of sangria, which as always was top notch. My in-laws ordered bruschetta - they ended up with a ton of untoasted bread with a very thin coat of ricotta and a light topping of good quality tomatoes. Tasty but not bruschetta and definitely not worth $14. My husband and I got the ""artisan board"" with one meat and one cheese. For $13, we got a teeny tiny piece of cheese, four thin slices of not-so-good sopressata, stale bread, 2 crackers, raw unsalted almonds, six grapes, and about half a jar of very oniony cornichons! The food was a huge rip-off, and not at all the quality or quantity we have gotten in the past. The saving grace of the night was the sangria, which I still think is one of the best in the area. But overall, I don't think this place is worth a trip out anymore.","sangria, bruschetta, artisan board,"

My freind got the hamburger and I got the shrimp scampi. Her hamburger was better then the lasagna but was still lacking flavor. My scampi was better then the chicken but was also still under seasoned and the noodles were a bit under cooked.

The rice and chicken served in a vertical bamboo cup was tasty; flavors were similar to Vietnamese 'com ga', with ginger, light soy, and chicken.  The xiu mai had orange/yellow 'eggs' on it which tasted like crab innards/tomal/mustard; rich and super flavorful.  All the dumplings were packed with meat and/or seafood and not a lot of fillers (yay!).  The only downside is that the offerings are limited/uninspired; just the basics.

BOTH TIMES I have tried to convey something to the serving staff, in hopes that it gets to the kitchen- that food is greasy  and items are inedible. Twice the staff has cut me off mid-sentence, and responded that ""this is how item x is made,"" - as if customers were not eating at other restaurants (even the same dishes; something basic, like a hash brown!) without this trouble.  Some perspective: paying customers should be able to order food that they can and want to eat, no matter what. Always. Even if it's fried.  It's understood some items on the plate are fried in fat, but the dish should not be unpleasant, revoltingly oily, even if it has a fried component.  The hash browns are literally, round oil sponges.

Because I really want to like it... BUT Both times the food was too greasy for me to eat, and both times the people I have been with, also did not enjoy their food. This last time one of my friends had to send his food back because it was too salty (the ham) and too greasy (the toast). They were nice about it and did not charge him.   BOTH TIMES I have tried to convey something to the serving staff, in hopes that it gets to the kitchen- that food is greasy  and items are inedible. Twice the staff has cut me off mid-sentence, and responded that ""this is how item x is made,"" - as if customers were not eating at other restaurants (even the same dishes; something basic, like a hash brown!) without this trouble.  Some perspective: paying customers should be able to order food that they can and want to eat, no matter what. Always. Even if it's fried.  It's understood some items on the plate are fried in fat, but the dish should not be unpleasant, revoltingly oily, even if it has a fried component.  The hash browns are literally, round oil sponges. Disgusting.  This is the oiliest brunch in town. Hands down. It's a shame because the space is so beautiful and open.

This is definitely a great place to go if you are craving something smokey and delicious.   I actually noticed this place because I wandered by when I was walking downtown and it's impossible to miss that lovely smokey/BBQ smell if you're on the block. However, it looks kind of like a hole in the wall. The entrance doesn't look like it's been updated in years, and that's ok because it just adds character. The entire decor is wood/country (to include buffalo head on the wall) and there is also a downstairs where there is live music on the weekends.  Ok onto the food. I have been here a couple of times now, so I think I can comment on the menu pretty well. My friends and I have ordered the brisket, the catfish, the veggie burger, the mac n cheese, the cesar salad, the chili, and the garlic fries. If I had to review this place based on the delicious and garliciness of their fries, this would be a 5-star review hands down. I mean, seriously, vampires beware, but everyone else should enjoy a-plenty.  The portion sizes are huge, so go hungry or be prepared for a to-go box (granted every time I've gone I have loved the food so much that I ate the entire meal.)   I bet at this point in time you are wondering why I am only giving this place 4 stars then? Well, not everything is as amazing as those garlic fries. The bourbon apples are fairly tasteless, the chili is ok (the meat was very tough), and the service is also just ok. However, the catfish is delightful, the mac and cheese is also delicious, and the brisket is quality.   The specialty cocktails are also pretty good, and the beer prices are pretty decent. This is a great place to go for a long lunch, after dinner drink, or even a weekend brunch. There are vegetarian options on the menu (if you can ignore the buffalo head on the wall) and I believe even a few gluten-free options as well. It's a fairly good place to go with a large group, just make sure to call ahead.

Even though I didn't try the restaurant, Bouchon, the smells emanating from the kitchen made my mouth water. The casino was expansive and had signs everywhere for easy navigation. Rooms are huge, clean, and well-maintained. The convenience store and bakery/coffeeshop is located at the entrance to the casino and near the elevators to the rooms which is a plus if you need to get a quick pick-me-up or forgot to pack something. The Venetian is a must-stay if you are ever in Las Vegas and will give you a dining, gambling, and staying experience that you will never forget.","Venetian is an elegant and distinguished"

We ended off with the 22 oz. porterhouse steak, which was cooked perfectly to order and was more than enough for the both of us.

The room itself was dimmed and the ambiance was more intimate.  In conclusion, the food quality is above standard, service and cleanliness is high, and the atmosphere is intimate. The food is more old fashioned, come here for a great steak done right at a slightly higher price range than the keg.","Cheese Toast,beef tartare,small biscuits,porterhouse steak,drinks"

I don't have any pictures to post because we ate everything too fast!  We used the check-for free coffee and tea to start while we munched on the complementary granola, which was a nice roasted salty and sweet flavor.  Then our savory crepes came out quickly, the breakfast burrito for him and a custom buckwheat for me (white cheddar since they were out of Gouda, with local ham).  Mine came with a side of dressed greens that complemented the crepe well.  I was disappointed I could only order scrambled eggs on the side when I wanted a gooey poached egg because they had already cracked all the eggs, so I skipped the eggs.  As we finished up our main course our sweet crepe came out.  I was surprised how full I was from the one savory crepe, but I made room for my half of a simple bruleed crepe with nuts.  You can really taste the quality of the crepe itself when it's minimally dressed.  We finished with the complementary dessert of chocolate triangles and a rose infused marshmallow roasted right at the table.  Overall I'm very happy with our experience and the friendly service.  We struck up some good conversation with the server and found everyone but the cashier to be friendly.  I will definitely be back soon!","coffee, tea, granola, buckwheat, gooey poached egg, chocolate triangles"

I'd been here before but always sat in the front of the restaurant... had NO clue how HUGE this place was!!! We sat in the very back (where it seems many of the large birthday parties were seated) The ambiance of the restaurant is very dark and jungle esque (if i remember correctly o.o) lol very ruckusy and vegas appropriate! There were drummers and scandalous (but h0t) dancers going up and down the aisles which provided for the fun entertainment.  But enough of that, on to the main event.   We had a party of 6 and decided it best to do as our super nice server suggested, omakase style :)  - Cucumber cocktail on the house!!! They brought each of us a mini cocktail to start the meal off! Very nice and considerate of them! nice and refreshing and definitely got my appetite going :)  - A trio appetizer platter consisting of well salted edamame, roasted shito peppers, and deep fried string beans served in the most delicious chipotle aoli sauce (all 3 were delicious but I think my favorite would have to be the roasted shito peppers with a drizzle of lime juice for a nice kick) - Yellowtail Sashimi MINI TACOS!!! These were sooo fun and delicious! Great fushion idea! The restaurant is VERY accommodating, we mentioned to them 1 of the girls is allergic to cilantro so they brought out a special lobster taco for just for her! The flavors were bold and the taco shell was nice and crispy.  But I think I still enjoy DOS CAMINO'S mini tacos better...those are to.die.for.   - Ahi tuna over a piece of bamboo and basil leaf.  This was an interesting combination.  Probably my least favorite dish of the night.  The basil leaf was a bit overwhelming and covered the taste of the ahi too much.  - Filet Mignon with oversized asparagus.  The meat was tender and very well cooked, very pink in the middle.  I'm not a big beef eater so I only ate the edges of the piece but my friends seemed to enjoy it.  Definitely not one of the top dishes of the night but was still yummy.  The ASPARAGUS however, was QUITE delicious!! they probably cooked it in butter... hahaha i'll take it :) A good bite on the outside and nice and tender on the inside!  - Sea Bass with oversized Peruvian corn!!! YUMMMY!!!! The sea bass was nice and flaky.  Flavoring was a bit salty but I feel like at these restaurants they tend to do that a bit...i mean, everyones a bit intoxicated so salty foods are what people want LOL The peruvian corn was just really fun to eat!! My friends really enjoyed it but I definitely like summer sweet white corn on the cob better :)  - MUSHROOM POT ON CRACK. THIS WAS DEFINITELY THE SHOW STOPPER OF THE NIGHT!!! the flavoring of the sauce, the textures of the 3? 4? different mushrooms. happiness. The sauce was like a cream of mushroom, milky, full flavored, salty, a hint of sweetness... too good. needless to say we all took a bite and just smiled in satisfaction. We all stared at each other and knew rice was needed to soak up all that bomb sauce!!  - 4 different Sushi Rolls were brought out last (3.5 stars).  All 4 were decent, nothing really to rave much about unfortunately. :(  I'm a big big sushi lover and have had some off the chart rolls so I can't pretend these were anything to die for.    ***The first time I came my friend ordered for the table and I definitely think that made a difference.  They have some REALLY scrumptious dishes that I wish I could've ordered for my friends to try!! Perhaps next time!! I'll be more prepared lol   OVERALL RATINGS: Food - 3.75 stars (except for the mushroom pot on crack... 4.5 stars for that) Food (for the first time I came) - 4.25 stars!  Drink - 4 stars for the cucumber cocktail & bottle of Santa Margaritta Pino Grigio Presentation - 4 stars Service & Ambiance - 4 stars  I gave this place 4 stars mainly because I had a great time that night, and the company I kept definitely played a big part in that.  The food IS goood, just a bit $$$$.  Its definitely a GREAT place to go with a group thats just looking for some good eats, good drinks, and a great time :O) BOTTOM LINE: I'd DEFINITELY GO BACK AGAIN!!","NONE"

It's so popular that I didn't try it until recently. The bubble tea here is really good. It's pricier than the one in Rose tea, but you also get more.  I like that noodles with pork sauce. I've tried both the thin and wide/thick noodles. The wide one is less chewy and are kind of sticky. I prefer the thin one for this dish. Dan dan noodles are different from what I was expecting. My friend liked it but it's just okay for me. The noodle with wonton is flavorless to me.  The soup dumplings are good but not amazing. If you've never had it before, give it a try and you probably will like it. I'd like to try noodles with beef soup next time.  The appetizers are too pricy in my opinion. I won't pay $6 for a small plate of vegetables again...  The owner is a nice guy and I enjoyed chatting with him a little bit during dinners.","BUBBLE TEA TOSE TEA NOODLES  NOODLES WITH BEEF SOUP"

I'm very impressed with The Sparklings. I waited months and months for it to open and even asked ""when are you opening"" to a construction worker once :)  It is truly amazing the remodel that was done inside of this building. The inside used to have private hibachi rooms for goodness sake.   The ambiance of the former sushi joint  is now an updated and posh Martha Stewart worthy lounge. Whatever the hell that means, I just made it up. Sounds weird huh? Just look at the pics it's truly lovely. The chandelier that everyone takes pics of and talks about is magical.  The menu is a more causal (Sage like) menu. Modern American Fusion? Who cares about the title. It's just good food.   We have not ordered entrees here YET because we have already had dinner or were on our way to dinner on our visits.   They said that they can accommodate to vegan for us no problem. I look forward to a pasta or a special custom creation. The items that we have had (so far) are very good.  Portobello fries, flat bread, salads....wine, wine, and more wine :)  The service is super accommodating, almost too much service. I guess because they are newer they want to help and help a lot. Lol.  The over-service was only in the dining area. In the lounge the service is perfect.  I truly love the way the did the garage door in the lounge and the way the patio area looks.  I really want to sit in that left hand side back lounge booth with a ton of people. It's really soooo big it could fit 10+++ people. I love it. Their left side dining area private table would make a large gathering super fun.    I will update when we order full entrees and remember to take more pics since we are here soo much.   Just go, it's a marvelous addition to the beautiful SW area. I am proud to be a regular.     Oh and hubby said no I could not redecorate our whole house like the inside of The Sparklings :(((((((;  ;)","Portobello fries, flat bread, salads....wine, wine, and more wine"

However what is putting them from a solid 3 to a 4 is the value and service. Seriously, a chopped or caesar salad for 3.95? 5-7pm Happy Hour that includes half off starters, pizzas, and glasses of wine, wow, for real!   So with that being said we had a great time at Marcella's, yes folks a chain, but a decent chain with only a few locations in Ohio. The straight forward menu makes for easy navigation and the helpful suggestive service was more than enough to make decisions easy.   Okay, we kinda freaked out when  we heard the half off starts and pizzas.. we ordered way to much but was so worth it.   Started with the meaty Sicilian pizza, topped with Capacola, Salami, Meatballs, Asiago Cheese, Red Onion, which was probably my favorite. The crust was thin and crunchy and all of the flavors of the meats and cheese really were balanced so I could taste each with one bite after the next.  Beef Carpaccio was a close runner up with its thinly shaved rare beef, toasted capers and wild arugula. The flavors were bright thanks in part to the lemon aioli.  The Braised Veal Meatball was so light and tender I wanted to order another as my entree rather than the Gnocchi con Bolognese . The problem with the gnocchi was the gnocchi themselves. Kind of like eating raw biscuit dough, but the lamb bolognese was simple and delicious.   The Chicken Parmesan was served how I like to eat with both alfredo & tomato sauce. My only wish is that it had just a bit more sauce so I could use the house ciabatta to sop up the extra.   Desserts are kept simple like the rest of the menu so we shared with Cherry Crustada. The crust was light and flaky, the cherries filling slightly tart and the ice cream rich and creamy, *pant pant* yum!  This was certainly a pleasant experience with a welcoming laid back feel, generous portions and affordable pricing. Oh yes, they also use Opentable.com for free online reservations, so yes, I'm definitely a fan!!!","caesars salad, pizza, wine, sicilian pizza, beef carpaccio, braised veal meatball, gnocchi con bolognese, chicken parmesan, house ciabaata, cherru crustada,"

She is a very excellent cook herself and would tell the waiter if something was not to her liking. The salsa was perfect each time, with just the right amount of heat and spice, not overwhelmingly tomato-y or salty. In fact, I told the chef (who was leaving for the day) that I came from SF to have his salsa and he prepared a pound of FRESH chips and a pint of my favorite salsa to go, with a thank you note (he did this in less than 5 minutes). I've never had such consistently delicious food, great service, and wonderful dining moments in the area than at Laredo.","hot meal,salsa,FRESH chips,pint"

Miss Dee, the owner I believe, was one of the nicest owners I have met at a restaurant. She immediately came out of the kitchen and personally greeted us with amazing hospitality. She gave us the low down of her spot answering any questions about the food we had. Now onto the meat and potatoes, literally! Three of us got a large loaded potato, each topped with different meats. One had the beef brisket, the other had pulled pork, and I got the buffalo chicken. Don't expect your food to come out in a minute like it was just microwaved. Everything was freshly put together and it was beyond worth it! Each meat was cooked to perfection with amazing flavors throughout the potato.

Don't get me wrong its a nice modern place but I can find better made items that Honey Salt offers for way cheaper price.  The only good thing that I was blown away by is their Fried Calamari.  That was a pretty legit dish.  Their biloxi buttermilk fried chicken sandwich I believe i can get somewhere else for cheaper and made better.  We also got their Caesars Salad and that was literally 14 dollars for some salad with a touch of caesars dressing and some cheap ""free range"" chicken breast that was grilled.  Overall not too impressed with what they served.  And this is on a hunch but if bread was given to everyone as an opener then they most def didn't care for us.  Everyone else had bread on their tables but us, don't know if you had to order it or not.    Again, overall the place is well lit and looks great.  Foodwise....id go somewhere else.  As a local i should've known better but wanted to try something new.  Now i know, i won't go back.  There are other places around town to get same food for cheaper price and same quality.

After my second, alcohol only, visit, I was excited to taste what vegetarian options they had.  I had the grilled cheese with spicy asparagus and portobello.  Let me tell you...grilled cheese is amazing, add a few interesting touches, it becomes addicting.  I was very happy with my sandwich.  Also, they have a very tasty appetizer of Goat Cheese Fritters with a red wine sauce.  Goat Cheese is one of my favorites and frying anything makes it better. I was in love.   Ther service is great and they can accomadate large groups, the few times I've been has been with 7-20 people.

When I discovered that Jewish delis were into tongue too (and liver, yum!), I pretty much loved hitting up inexpensive places to nosh.  I was kind of depressed in Vegas because... well, on the Strip, you pass by all these famous delis that basically rape your wallet.  You can imagine how happy I was to find the Bagel Cafe!

In addition, we wanted coffee refills and no one ever came back to ask us!!  When I inquired about the no cheese the server told me no it doesn't come with it, and when I asked the owner she said that that isn't the correct way western omelets traditionally  are served! She argued with me about the history of the western omelet instead she should have been more focused on her customers being happy, especially since we I told her it was our first time there and we were excited to try her food Quite honestly, I don't look for a class lesson when I go out to eat I just want good food and good customer service, I got neither today!  The correct thing for the server and the half wit owner would have been to say, "" sorry sir but I would be happy to redo your omelet with cheese and make u another order of hash browns and make sure they are crispy"".  But guess what none of that happened!  I have cooked in restaurant my whole life and I have never heard of any omelet not coming with some type of cheese and even if she was correct in her history, she definitely failed me at her customer service skills. In addition, when paying for my food I was told that they only take cash so I had to go out and get cash to pay for this horrible experience and that didn't sit well with me, I almost said screwed it, but my conscience said don't do it, so I went back and paid my bill.  Long story short, if you want good customer service and u want good food I would recommend going to Denny's or Bob Evans.

He made great recommendations, and the timing of everything was amazing.  Sitting outside and enjoying champagne was heavenly.  Please go to Vintner Grill.  It is worth the drive from the Strip.

I asked for a #10 Hunter's Club with all the veggies. What I got was the standard #10 Hunters Club with lettuce and tomatoes.   After seeing that, I took it back up to the counter, and explained that I wanted all the veggies. They explained to me that those were all the veggies the sandwich came with. I carefully explained that I wanted all of the veggies that they have. The guy said, oh, you want the Freebies. I would have thought he would have clarified when I ordered whether I just wanted everything that came on the sandwich, or the Freebies as well. I said yes, I wanted all of the Freebie Veggies.   I took my revised sandwich and sat down to eat it, only to find that along with the veggies I had requested, they had piled on Italian vinaigrette and Dijon mustard, which I did NOT want.","#10 Hunter's Club"

I would rate 3 1/2 vs 3. Really better than ok but I'm not sure that it rates 4 stars. It was a good restaurant but had some pretty big negatives.   The first thing that I notice was how large the restaurant was. It seemed to go on forever. Which was amazing considering how quickly our food came out. They have an open kitchen so you can see how many people they have working in the kitchen. Needless to say it's busy.   One drawback as others have mentioned is the noise level. Fortunately my husband and I were sitting by drapery panels so the 2 of us could carry on a conversation. Others sitting more towards the inside of the restaurant would have a difficult time hearing each other. Another issue is that it is pretty dark. I understand ambiance but this was a little too much. They know this so they do compensate and make the print larger on the menu. When it came to eating and my food was the same color (fish and cauliflower) it was hard to tell exactly what I was putting on the fork.  Our server was very good. Attentive and full of information when clarification was needed for the menu. We had Avocado bruschetta which was just okay. I should of skipped it. I ordered the Pacific Sea Bass. The fish was good and so was the cauliflower. They only thing I didn't care for was the preserved grapefruit. The funny thing is that while eating it I said to my husband that I didn't like the orange flavor that I was sometimes getting on the fish. It was either orange or when they preserve it then it totally changes the taste profile from grapefruit to orange. My husband had the lasagna bolognese. He was happy with his choice.  Overall, a good restaurant. I took off since it was extremely dark and loud. Also, the food comes out almost too quick if you just want to sit and talk. The food was good, especially for the price, not excellent.","fish and cauliflower, avocado bruschetta, pacific sea bass, preserved grapefruit, lasagna bolognese"

I live across from the Fajita Grill.  I have only been there twice (in 4 years).  As many of the other reviewers have said, the food is sub-par Mexican food.  I appreciated the complementary chips and salsa, and the incredibly unhealthy Boat Dip was pretty decent.  I had the Tofu Mexicana, which was mushy tofu and overcooked vegetables.  As hit or miss as Mad Mex can be, since it opened I have been there more times than Fajita Grill.   It is BYOB, but when I eat Mexican I want an ice cold margarita.  They also charge for sharing plates ($2.50) and ask that you split your check prior to ordering.","mexican food"

We tipped over 25% because our server was great and the experience of eating in the Dark was a pretty interesting experience.  #3. The food was Meh... I would have been okay with everything else if the food was outstanding. It really wasn't... I probably ate 3 bites of my dinner entree just to taste what the different Ingredients were... It was far from savory and could have used even a pasta or something. A couple of dry (what tasted like hush puppies)?? I would have been impressed a little if when I told the server that I didn't enjoy it if he would have offered to try one of the others, but I didn't make a big deal because like I said before he was really nice. The dessert was literally the only saving grace.  All in all I gave a 2 star... (server and experience in the dark)... I just have to be honest incase others go in expecting a non-vegetarian meal...

The overall concept is quite fun - as an activity alone, we would rate this 5 stars - it is REALLY fun and something you can imagine yourself doing over and over as a social event.  Why two stars, you ask?  There are major issues with this place that test your patience.  First off, when you walk in, its total pandemonium (we came here at 3pm on Friday).  There are two line queue's but no signage or help as to what the lines are for, or where to even stand in line.  As it turns out, the first line is the ""membership line"" - everyone needs a $5 membership.    The second line, is to ""check in"" - by which they scan your new membership card and ask whether you want a bay on a specific floor.    Both of those tasks sound SO easy - and they should be - yet we still waited in line for about 40 minutes to accomplish these two tasks.  The entire time, we and everyone else in line are talking about how inefficient this place is and you would think the managers would see this once, and rearrange things to make it easier.  After all, we really wanted a beer - we could have been through two rounds at the bar in the same amount of  time we spent waiting around to check in.    After all that, we still went to the bar and had two rounds while we waited.  Good selection of beer, bartenders were fast to see that we wanted booze and wasted no time in getting it.    Then, we get our text message - our bay is ready, requiring us to go muscle into the line and tell the check in staff we are ready (which then irritates everyone in line because you are obviously butting in), but thats the way they like it here I guess.    We head to our bay with a ""bay concierge"" that gives us the down low on the mechanics of play.  Its not the most intuitive thing in the world, but it works.    We start hitting balls and our waiter shows up.  He literally walks us through the entire menu, page by page, explaining burgers, and appetizers, and frozen margaritas like we had never been to a pub before and didn't know what a ""slider"" was.  (Mind you, you pay by the hour at this place, so someone taking your time is quite annoying).  We order a bucket of beer and chips and guac, and shoo him off and get back to our golf.  Beers arrive, chips arrive - and our waiter arrives..... and stays.... and gets all chatty about football and where my family is from, and his Grandma in Colorado, and what it was like working after Christmas, and all sorts of topics that none of us care to talk about.  ugh, leave us alone - we are here for golf and beer, not a new pal.  When the chips came out, one in my party leaned over to the server and said, ""do you know one thing thats missing in this place?""  The server leaned in all interested.... ""napkins - there are no napkins on the table"".  Our server launched into a story about why there are no napkins - another server spilled a huge tray of soda into a bussing cart and that knocked over someones golf bag, and on and on and on..... and no napkins.  He stopped talking and stared at us - and we asked him, ""could we have napkins?"" - and there was this 'oh yeah' moment - he was oblivious at times.  So, we shoo waiter off to get another bucket of beer and a refill of chips, and he comes back with the beer, and no chips (and again, all chatty - does this guy have other tables?).  The refill of chips took about 20 minutes.  We came at an odd time, and we were expected home for dinner, but the burgers and sandwiches on other tables looked very good.  The kicker though, was that near the end of our session, our new buddy server out of the blue told us that the day after Christmas, there was a five hour wait, and they ran out of food, and booze, and kegs, etc.  He told us that they were going to get a lot of negative reviews for that on an email service card that is sent to you the next day after playing.  He asked us if we wouldn't mind marking everything 5 stars because they really needed the good marks, and he would buy us desert if we said yes.    OK, this is the business guy in me coming out now, but the whole reason for getting feedback from your customers is to IMPROVE and figure out where you are failing.  The fact that you have a 40 minute check in process, or that you ran out of beer one night, or that there are no napkins on the table, or that there seems to be tons of staff walking around but not helping the bottlenecks - these are ALL issues that management needs to be aware of - but instead, they try to bribe you so that you will rate them the way they want to be rated.

I think the buffet at Treasure Island used to be called Dishes or something and I remembered it being pretty good. Unfortunately, ""The Buffet"" as it's now known has declined quite a bit in quality.  First, all of the meats are pre-sliced which is crazy. The slices of prime rib were totally dried out and starting to turn grey. The turkey fared a little better, but gravy rescues pretty much everything although either the turkey or gravy was very salty. Speaking of salty, I was curious to try the pho which was, you guessed it, super salty. There is no salad bar here and instead you can get various salads made that looked really good - too bad no one was manning the counter. And finally, the most ridiculous thing of all was the pre-scooped ice cream in dishes which had melted into a soup. On the plus side, the crab legs weren't bad and I enjoyed the mini donuts and chocolate covered strawberries.  I hope this buffet gets their act together soon. Sightly unrelated, but this was my first time at TI in a long time and I couldn't stand the smell of the casino! They pump some weird coconut sunblock smell all over the place which is way worse than stale cigarette air.

However, our group was quite disappointed with this restaurant. Granted, we were expecting a lot from an Italian restaurant in the Venetian, but I also think those are fine expectations to have when eating at these prices.  First, we changed our reservation, and they said they could accommodate the time. Clearly, they shouldn't have. We were seated at a folding table in the hallway next to the restaurant, quite literally in the food court next to a kiosk selling trinkets to tourists. Whatever ambiance this restaurant might offer is a mystery to me. They shouldn't have switched the reservation if it wasn't possible to accommodate the change (our fault, wouldn't blame them). I know they threw a table together as our table and chairs looked different from the rest of the ones set up. A few were just in front of the restaurant but not off to the side like ours was.  I expected to pay a lot in the Venetian, but I expected to be blown away. I would have preferred dining at several places we walked at on the way to this one. I paid $17 for spaghetti carbonara. It was very tasty, a well-balanced sauce with a decent amount of pancetta. However, I finished the whole thing. I can't finish an entree at Olive Garden for the same price. I also ate a few pieces of bread. One of my friends ordered a chicken kabob (who knows why that's sold at an Italian restaurant). It was one single kabob with perhaps 4-5 pieces of chicken and 4-5 vegetables on a bed of rice and it cost $25! Absolutely outrageous.   To top it off, we told the waiter we were celebrating a birthday. He said ok, so I expected we would receive a dessert, as is customary. We received nothing. Of course, our waiter didn't seem keen on giving us the time of day so I don't know why I expected him to remember a birthday.","none"

I'm not a native so when I moved to the area many years ago everyone advised my family that we absolutely had to try a burnt almond torte from Prantl's.  We did, and to be fair that is a great dessert.  However, I have worked across the street from them for a decade now, and the office ladies I work with have brought in nearly everything they sell at Prantl's over the last decade.  The cookies, the cupcakes, the junior pastries, danishes, donuts, etc... have all made there way into our office, and I have never been wowed by any of them.  In fact I find most items to be pretty sub par.  I think if Prantl's wasn't a true bakery and merely a shop that produced one signature cake it would probably deserve five stars, but that's not the case, and since I have to judge on the totality of their products as a bakery, not only the burnt almond torte which is their claim to fame and recognition, I find them to be quite lackluster overall.  If you want a true bakery treat I would suggest  La Gourmandine for anything, Vanilla for cupcakes, Jean Marc Chatellier, even the somewhat overrated Oakmont Bakery, as other than the burnt almond torte, you are paying specialty bakery prices but getting Giant Eagle quality, which is fine, but at that point you might as well go to Giant Eagle and pay accordingly.","burnt almond torte, cookies, cupcakes, junior pastries, danishes, donuts"

I frequent this place for lunch and use them for work events pretty frequently and have always had a decent experience but not this time.  When I got home and went to unpack the food, I realized the order was completely wrong. Checked the receipt and the order that was rung in was completely different then what I asked for and with totally different quantities. It was as if the order was erased and the guy just tried to make it up out of memory. Certainly was not please to have ordered mainly calzones and end up with almost all subs.  The most annoying part of the experience is the sausage, pepper and onion subs were 85% peppers and onions. There was about 10 slices of very very thin sausage on the entire sandwhich which I think is a ripoff for $8.99.

I came here with my boyfriend for lunch and we both ordered the rotisserie chicken sandwich. The sandwich had good flavours, however the server suggested that we change the slaw if we don't like horseradish. Really glad that I did because it seemed to make more sense with the slaw that we substituted. We ordered a side of fries as it is not included with the sandwich, and were presented with a hefty bowl of tasty shoestring fries which neither of us could finish.  However, the chicken was really dry. And when I say dry, I mean you need to soak your mouth with water to get some flavour and juice out of it. I always thought that rotisserie chicken was meant to be juicy, but this chicken seriously lacked the juice that you would normally expect.   I think this restaurant has a lot of potential, it's situated in a great neighbourhood, trendy indoors and nice patio that offer a warm welcome with very friendly service.

I came here with my boyfriend for lunch and we both ordered the rotisserie chicken sandwich. The sandwich had good flavours, however the server suggested that we change the slaw if we don't like horseradish. Really glad that I did because it seemed to make more sense with the slaw that we substituted. We ordered a side of fries as it is not included with the sandwich, and were presented with a hefty bowl of tasty shoestring fries which neither of us could finish.  However, the chicken was really dry. And when I say dry, I mean you need to soak your mouth with water to get some flavour and juice out of it. I always thought that rotisserie chicken was meant to be juicy, but this chicken seriously lacked the juice that you would normally expect.   I think this restaurant has a lot of potential, it's situated in a great neighbourhood, trendy indoors and nice patio that offer a warm welcome with very friendly service. In fact, I would say the service is the only reason that I'm giving it three stars.   If you're going to do chicken, at least learn how to make it right.","none"

Did not disappoint! A 9 table restaurant, intimate, contemporary but not stuffy decor, washrooms spotless, service friendly and on point. They truly want your dining experience to be a cut above the rest. They are attentive without being intrusive and the FOOD.... the gnocchi was suggested to us by a guest seated nearby who heard we were new to town. This selection was wonderful, pillowy dumpling puffs with lobster and truffle oil... I was sold! My husband and I shared this plate of deliciousness and the restaurant will split the plate for you in the kitchen, no problem. The fresh bread came with shallot butter - WOW, a must try, I love flavoured butters! For the main meal trio, I got the Dock Side which is a perfect scallop, perfect shrimp and the most tender, buttery fish filet once can ask for. My husband chose the meat option and he too could only describe his filet as ""butter"" and loved everything else that accompanied it. The small hot pots with the fresh veg inside in a butter broth were hits as well! The sparkling volcanic water was a nice change for us and the wine list was beyond impressive. We each had one glass, a red and white. MMMMM! Everything here is 100% Italian including the waiters and it was so nice to see how knowledgeable they are about the menu and passionate about what they serve! The chef obviously took a lot of pride in her work and created for us, THE perfect plates! The end of the meal sadly came and although we were stuffed, we chose to share the lemon curd with berries plate to cleanse the palate. The best choice we could of made - or was it?! We will have to find out next time we come! We enjoyed the location of Capo in Inglewood, quite central and the waiter who called a taxi for us even waited with us outside chatting with us until the cab came. What a gem of an eatery if you can afford to splurge now and then! A highlight of my week and would recommend to anyone!","gnocchi, lobster dumlings,bread and shallot butter, lemon curd with berries,"

We arrived early to avoid long waits and drunk people.  By the time we left, we might have been the very people we were trying to avoid!  Drinks aside, we enjoyed the flaming fajitas!  We ordered the fajitas for 2 with steak and shrimp.  It is more than enough for 2 people.  My hubs and I made 7 fajitas from the meat.  We can't speak to any of the other food.  OH WAIT!  Now I remember, we had an AMAZING desert.  A sopapilla topped with ice cream and strawberries.  It was DELISH!!    We met Juan the owner who welcomed us and our little toddler.  Juan said he built the place to accomodate families and that their daily Happy Hours are restaurant-wide - and not exclusive to the bar only like many places in town.  Their daily happy hour from 3-7pm looked really good!   Our server was very friendly and the service was great!  The Mariachi band was an added bonus - we would love to return to hear them again.  They were very good!    This is a place worth visiting!  Good food, good drinks, good prices, and good service!  Locally owned.  Flaming Fajitas - what more can you ask for!!!","chips ,Salsa,Cinco de Mayo food,fajitas,shrimp,ice cream"

Instead, I'll focus on what I perceived to be an entirely fun and delicious dining experience.   To start, our waitress brought it to our attention that it was $1 Corona night. Not only that, but HuHot has a pretty decent selection of beers. Win.   As part of your meal, you get your choice of fried rice, white rice, or warm tortillas. Another addition to the all-you-can-eat meal was egg drop soup, which was very tasty.   We ordered crab rangoons for our appetizer - which the waitress said were made in-house - and they were pretty great. Enough so that I was a little bummed that there were only four rangoons to eat between the three of us.   A unique selection of meat, veggies, and noodles makes up the main course. There are recipe cards at your table and as you approach the bar to help you make a decent little dish. If you trust your inner instincts as a cook, you'll do just fine without the cards when it comes to these areas.   Mind your sauces though. This is where things get a little tricky and can really make-or-break your dish. If you don't know your sauces, go with the cards. If you insist on winging it, there is a heat meter above the sauce area to help make sure your food isn't TuHot.   Besides that corny joke, what's there really to complain about here? Our limes were a little on the old side on our first round of Coronas. The mushrooms were running a little low both times I ran through the line. The jalapenos were hotter than Hades.  Minor.  This was an enjoyable experience through and through.  Oh, and you get to watch your cooks try to do tricks with spatulas. What more can you possibly ask for?   This was my second time at HuHot, and I'll be back for more.","none"

She decided on getting the pork belly ramen and two sushi rolls. The ramen was good, a little salty, but I'd recommend it. Then we received the Spider roll, which was great. Next up was the Crispy roll, which was where the problems arose. We had to wait over 45 minutes for one roll. After about half an hour they finally brought us a different roll to apologize for it taking so long. Apparently they didn't have the crispy rice prepped so that was what was taking so long. I myself am a server, and although the server came over and apologized several times, it probably would have been a good idea to have the manager come and apologize. We finally got it and it was okay, and they ended up comping it, which was nice. I'd give this place one more try...But I most limey wouldn't order the crispy rice roll again.","none"

Went with my daughter and two of her friends- and I totally loved this place! I liked the high ceilings, the cozy decor, the lighting, and the marketplace feel of the interior... Because of numerous raves on yelp, we ordered the bacon wrapped dates for an appetizer. It's true, they are totally fabulous- not to be missed!   I had chicken scaloppini, which was delicious- perfectly prepared, and served with just the right amount of sauce and Mediterranean olives. The girls all ordered pasta dishes- raved about, and then subsequently demolished them. There wasn't one crumb of food left on anyone's plate!   The focaccia bread with pesto is wonderful, and they have a great wine list here. I had a glass of Syrah from Washington state, which was thankfully served at the right temperature and was very nicely balanced. We were celebrating one of my daughter's friend's birthdays, so our delightful waiter brought us a complimentary dessert- an ""ice cream bar,"" which had ice cream, marshmallow, and lots of rich, luscious chocolate. It was totally delicious, and reminded us of a s'more.  Olive & Ivy is a nice place to people watch- the patio fronts the waterfront, and reminded me of a sidewalk cafe in Europe. I will definitely be back- only wish we had an Olive & Ivy in Tucson!","bacon wrapped dates,chicken scaloppini,focaccia bread with pesto,ice cream, marshmallow"

When we arrived right at 6p.m. there were plenty of OPEN tables in the restaurant.  When the hostess looked for our name on the reservation list it showed we were to be sat at table 14.  The list said in large print at the top..DO NOT CHANGE TABLES.  The hostess walked us past 8 - 10 2 person tables to sit us at a 2 person table literally 6inches from the neighboring table!  Could we have asked to sit elsewhere? Apparently not as the hostess was under direct orders not to change tables.  Could we have dined elsewhere...probably not considering it is Valentines Weekend and we drove 3 hours to get there and have no reservations any where else, and no idea at 6p.m. where to go.    So we sat.  We could hear EVERY WORD the table next to us said. (Which by the way when you take your pregnant wife out for Valentine's Day you probably shouldn't answer the phone when your buddies call or talk about how ""hot"" her female coworker is.)  This was so awkward, you had to watch every word you said to be sure the neighboring diners weren't eavesdropping on personal info. Most uncomfortable ""romantic"" evening of my life...  Now to the food.  The Valentine's Day meal was a choice of appetizer to share (except for one - they sold out the night before), a ""salad"", choice of any appetizer on the menu (again except for the New Zealand Rack of Lamb, because it too sold out the night before.), a Chocolate Creme Brulet to share for dessert, and a bottle of Nero D'Avola (which we were told is a $35 bottle of wine). We ordered two bowls of soup to go along with the special.   The soup - Lobster Bisque (Delicious) and Minestrone with sausage ( missing the sausage and the vegetable were literally giant sized. It was like eating a salad with broth and rice in it). However it did taste quite nice.  The appetizer - Artichokes with Prosciutto.. YUMMO!  The salad - hmm not what I had in mind. A tiny plate of Feta Cheese, cucumber, pear in balsamic vinegar and gosh knows what else...but NOT a traditional salad..So beware!  Taste was great, but if you are expecting a bowl of leafy greens and some toppings...This it is not.  The meal - Veal with shrimp and gnocchi..Quite pleasing to the palette.  The dessert - Chocolate Creme Brulet...   Umm not so much..it was quite clearly 3/4 cup of Chocolate Mousse with a sliced strawberry on top and a store bought sugar cookie in the shape of a heart.  Yes it did taste good, however...where was the Creme Brulet the waiter raved about?  The wine - Nero D'Avola...yes I am a red wine drinker, the wine was delicious.  But upon looking it up when we returned to the hotel room...found it only sold for $10 - $13 a bottle...Why the lie? We would have ordered the special anyway...  The atmosphere...beautiful, romantic (if you like sharing intimate moments with strangers) but it was pleasantly dark with candles and Christmas lights through out. They had an electric fireplace when we first sat down we observed and enjoyed the heat coming from it, since as you know we dress up, not dress warm when going out to dinner. The place lost half of its power 5 minutes after sitting down. The manager  chose to turn the fireplace off, even though it stayed lit and running during the power outage.  By the time I left, my toes were frozen.  We finished eating and paid for the bill at 7:50p.m. I turned around and noticed FOUR empty 2 person tables. They had never been sat, but we had to sit with an unfamiliar couple!   Upon leaving the hostess who was so sweet and friendly upon arrival was short and sarcastic in her good bye and have a nice evening.  Would I go back when in town again? No.  At the risk of being sat in that situation again.  The food can be the most delicious in the world, but I still prefer and deserve privacy when dining.  And to the lady we sat next to...Good luck on your birth, maybe your dislike for cheese will go away after you give birth.","salad,Chocolate Creme Brulet"

We both ordered all you can eat crab legs and they were fresh, hot and delicious. I do feel the sticker price was high but we must have had 5 buckets each so it equates to 10 bucks a pound.   The only negative I did feel could be addressed is the tables are made of some type of epoxy resin so being outside, May be melting or something because there was a sticky residue on the table top. I just played a napkin over it so it was acceptable.   My girlfriend and I will definitely be returning to pickle bills, we had a fantastic evening.

We have had issues here before with being seated (it took them 15 minutes when the place was empty one time), but tonight takes the cake.       We went to get food at 2am, pulled into the drive thru at 2:32. We waited there for 15 minutes, then we got trapped in the drive thru by a curb and other vehicles for 25 more minutes. I got incredibly fed up and walked inside. There were 2 tables seated - and they were already eating. One woman was ordering at the counter when I went in.       I asked the worker at the counter if they shut down the drive thru and if they could inform the people waiting at the speaker because we were stuck and just wanted to leave. All he said is ""I don't know if they shut down the drive thru but I can take your order here."" Like THAT DOESNT HELP US. We are STILL stuck in your crappy little drive thru and we don't even want to order here anymore. He said he would meet me outside - which he DIDNT by the way, but the line started to move so we said whatever and decided to still order because we had already waited 40 minutes.      After they got the person in front of us through the drive thru, they then told US to hold on a minutes because they are ""backed up inside"", but they weren't at all. The parking lot had 2 cars and 3 people behind us in line, and when I was inside, a server was sitting at a table texting. So don't tell me you are busy if your staff is getting paid for nothing. I yelled ""are you getting paid for this?"" Through the speaker and he had time to answer and tell me to CALM DOWN but couldn't take my damn order.      We finally left with out even PLACING an order after 49 minutes. Will not return and by the other reviews for this place, I should have checked yelp before ever coming here in the first place. Went to the Mentor one after and got served right away.","cake,"

Bad happens now.  The placed jam packed and I cannot locate my friends for over half an hour.  They were playing pretty good music, too bad I couldn't enjoy myself because I was on a mission to find my friends.  I find my friends, one of them is drunk, super drunk.  Within five minutes of meeting them, one of them pukes and next thing I know is we are being forced to leave.  Did I mention I had to pay $30 + service fee to get in????  But that was just my luck, I can't blame the venue for things like this.  Would have been better if they granted re-entry upon the rest of us returning to the pool - no. Sure there are rules and one of them happens to be no re-entry, but absolutely no flexibility?  Especially at a place where bouncers ask for $200 to bribe them (yes, this apparently happened earlier in the day to my friends).  It's a nightmare trying to take care of a drunk person and get the belongings (one coat check, meaning we had to take other people's belongings too).  You are not allowed in the hotel unless you have your bottoms on (reason why we had to get everyone's stuff).  I was handed the room key and room number via text because we thought it would be easier to get back in (although chances were very slim) as opposed to two.  The security calls for paramedics and they come to do their simple check up.  I was pissed and annoyed but they were doing their job so no complaints from a sober person point of view so that was okay.  We got the okay to go and I took the friend up to the room.  I get back to the Beach Club and explained I had my other friends' stuff AND the room key without which they will not be able to get back into the hotel.  I cannot reach the other friend with a phone.  Shoot, I'm thinking I'm not coming to Vegas again.  One of the security people approached me and asked how my friend was, HOW WONDERFUL HE ASKED! Because I also explained to him my current situation and he talked to the other people at the door and they let me in. See?  There is the reasonable flexibility.  (hence, two stars, not one)  So here is my real experience at Encore Beach Club:  There is just too many people.  You are just standing in water jumping up and down OR doing the same thing outside the pool.  It is too packed.  Getting drinks at the bar is unimaginable - the line is just insane.  With that many drunk people still drinking, who knows how much pee is present in the water???  The lifeguards are annoying as hell, blowing the whistles for every single thing - no splashing, etc.  They all go insanely crazy when a guy gets on the stripper pole area even for a second, I thought an arrest was about to be made with so many whistles going off.  If you have no issues dropping the dough you could spend purchasing a very decent DSLR, go for the tables and cabanas with wait service.  Otherwise, not worth the entrance fee.  By entering here though you have a full excuse to be at the douchiest level possible for guys or to act as if you have no brain for girls so if that's what you want (seemed like that's what everyone else wanted at this place), go here without the $$$$$.  Standard party goers in Vegas but this place by far the worst.  Lock box is available for $20 by the entrance.  Not going back.","Burger"

Well they totally nailed it, from the complementary chips and dip to the sauce stains on my napkin!  The dining area was empty and only a few people were at the bar upon my arrival for a late lunch. Adlai our server was very helpful with recommendations and was knowledgeable of the menu. I had a overstuffed grilled chicken taco which arrived with Mexican rice, mixed cabbage coleslaw and, their own, Charro style pintos, all at the incredible price of... drum roll please... 7 Bucks! My buddy tried Paco's Taco which is shredded beef and was equally as tasty. Servings are huge and everything was fantastic.   Premeal chips and salsa were delivered to the table immediately. The chips are very thin and were very fresh. The place was clean and attractive. Sanitation rating was a 95. For those long time Charlotteans like myself, you may remember this place as the old Manzetti's.  I'm going back soon!

My husband asked to sit at another table but the hostess said ""No"" so we had the baby between our table and the customers next to us, luckily she's a great baby!! The table and booth were dirty and floor was sticky, gross, and I had to kick a fork out from under my seat. The service was subpar but the waiter was nice. It took 20 mins for my boys to get their drinks and refills, well they were sparse to say the least. I ordered steamed broccoli which was actually raw when it came out the first time but they, what I believe, microwaved it to warm it up. My poor daughter in law had a charcoal patty which she sent back and it took a good 25-30 mins to be replaced. The worse part is my son has a sensitivity to gluten so he ordered a gluten free bun but they gave him a Ciabatta bun which he didn't realize until he had already eaten half the burger. My husband brought the issues up to the manager but she didn't really contribute anything to the situation other than sending the burnt burger back. The waiter's solution for the inconvenience was a free appetizer card to be redeemed the next time they came in. We live 3 1/2 hours from Mesa and it's so disappointing to run into this kind of service, this was definitely not a pleasant experience","steamed broccoli, charcoal patty, Ciabatta bun,"

Yes, we're fatsos at heart.   The drinks came in a timely manner, as did the donuts. Then we waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. AND WAITED. We are by no means slow eaters and we didn't stick around for very long after finishing our food, but we didn't leave this restaurant until close to 3pm! It was quite absurd how long our main dishes took to arrive. Definitely unimpressed with the service.   As for the food itself, I'd call it 'decent'. The donuts were delicious, but the chocolate mousse-like dip it came with was rather tasteless. Actually, I actively didn't like the chocolate dip and I LOVE chocolate. My duck scramble was good but nothing special. I loved the potatoes, but everything else just...normal.   Honestly, the best part about this place, in my opinion, is that it takes brunch reservations. I like the decor inside and it's apparently a very popular drink spot, but I probably won't be back for brunch unless all I want is an order of potatoes and a bellini.","caesar, a bellini, an order of donuts, the duck scramble, and the two egg breakfast,chocolate,potatoes"

I worked up my friends at how awesome and overwhelmingly large the Dutch Baby is (and that you could share it with two people), but it was a disappointment. It was bit dry, almost burnt and stale tasting.  Third, I felt very rushed. I know that there is a long line, but they were really pushy about cleaning up our plates immediately after we finished and it made for an uncomfortable eating experience.

Sure, it's a splurge (which is why we only end up here on New Year's Eve), but it's a worthy splurge.  This NYE, they had a prix fixe menu, in addition to a smaller-than-normal regular menu, but since we are samplers, we decided to each get the 5-course prix fixe so we could try as many things as possible.  I love that a trip to Sonoma Grille is not just dinner, it's an entire event.  Our waitress, Barb, was fantastic - knowledgeable about the menu, and passionate about it too.  They had just introduced some new items, so the servers had recently done their menu taste-test, and to hear her describe everything was like being there in the room as each dish was sampled and explained.  Sonoma Grille is regularly recognized as having one of the best wine selections in the city, and it's true.  The markup is a bit much, but again, you're paying for atmosphere and experience in addition to good California wines (I'd love to see a bit more Central Coast, as that's my favorite wine region, but the name is 'Sonoma,' so I give them a pass).  The staff can answer any question you have about the wine, which I really appreciate.  We started with the 'Trio of Amuse' appetizer, which had a parsnip bisque (light and flavorful), some oysters (which weird me out a bit, I must admit), and a teeny tiny beef carpaccio that was perfect in every way.  It was just one little nibble, but it was an insane burst of flavor.  While we were enjoying our wine and appetizer, the bread server came around with a selection of four different kinds of bread.  Instead of an individual table serving being brought to your table, a server comes with a large basket and serves you a few pieces of your choosing, plus olive oil for dipping.  I don't know why, but I love this little unique aspect of this restaurant.  For the larger appetizer (oh yes, two appetizers), we each got the jumbo lump crab and avocado plate.  This was gigantic - we could have easily split one between the two of us.  The crab pieces were huge, easily the size of garlic bulbs.  My only suggestion for this would be to have a few pieces of the crostini instead of just a little sliver at the bottom.  The actual plate was quite juicy, and the crunch of the crostini was a good balance.  Mmm, this was like crab guacamole, so in other words, amazing.  My husband and I each got different salads.  He opted for the fois gras salad (which he loved, even though I was a bit too squeamish to sample it), and I got what I shall refer to as the pile 'o beets.  Anyone who knows me knows my love affair with beets, and this was just perfect.  Slices of beets interspersed with goat cheese and well-seasoned... wish I could eat that every day.  Not very 'salad-y' but heavenly nonetheless.  There were five different options for entrees, but we both had our eye on only one thing: the filet mignon.  Oh. My. Word.  This steak was cooked to perfection - so tender and juicy that my mouth is watering just remembering it!  It came with garlicky whipped potatoes and broccolini (which I delicately pushed to the side - sorry broccoli, we're never going to be friends).  The portion was huge, and I had the second half wrapped up for lunch the next day.  We were nearly too full for dessert, but had to make room to try the chocolate ravioli.  It's a little weird, and the texture is a bit chewier than I would have thought, but the flavor was excellent.  It came with a nice blend of raspberry and vanilla sauce for dipping, and was perfect alongside a steaming cup of coffee.  All in all, we had another excellent experience.  Barb even offered to keep my leftovers in the fridge until after the midnight festivities, but I was afraid I'd forget in the massive crowd leaving downtown, so we walked it back to the car anyway.  I was not going to let myself miss out on a second meal of that filet in the aftermath of Pittsburgh fireworks lol.  This is one NYE tradition we plan on keeping for many years to come!","salad-y, gras salad"

(I forgot to take pictures because we were so hungry that we just dug into the food right away.) It didn't taste fresh, and the dumpling skin wasn't very soft. The sui mai looked OLD. I eat dim sum quite frequently and this was nowhere near the standards for dim sum in LA!   The best thing was probably the boiled Chinese broccoli dish (which tastes the same everywhere) and cha siu bao (but I've still had better). Gr.. Eating such horrible dim sum just made me crave better Chinese food in LA.   Service: It was difficult to find a server to refill our drinks and give us our check. However, the workers are friendly and   Note: It's located inside Gold Coast Casino. Some advice? Come early! This place isn't too big and there was a line when we arrived around 12:30pm until we left the restaurant a little before 2.","Har cherng, sui mai, har gow, cha siu bao, dumplings, dim sum, boiled Chinese broccoli"

My service has been absolutely horrible every time except for once when a girl named Jess waited on us. The rest of the waitresses are completely incompetent and utterly rude off the bat.   When we began ordering appetizers the waitress stopped us and asked if this was ""going to be complicated or not."" She then forgot to put in an order for 1 of 3 appetizers ordered. It took about 15 mins after getting 2 of them, to even bring that to her attention, for which she didn't even apologize. After 35mins and someone else bringing our food out, we finally had to go to the bar and ask someone to come take our drink orders, a task that was also messed up (I ordered their special of Big ass margeritas to which I received a small mason jar of mostly ice). They told me it'd be free, but it honestly wasn't even worth that. After that, the only time I saw our waitress was when she was visibly talking about us and pointing with another waitress. Completely unprofessional. A different waitress had to bring us our checks and messed that up too.   I had this same waitress the Tuesday before accompanied by the same crummy service. That's when I realized that it wasn't just a bad or busy night (it was a Tuesday for crying out loud), but that this woman is just REALLY bad at customer service. Definitely do NOT recommend going there!!! Don't know exactly which was our original waitress but our checks said Joanne G.

Hands down, Encore Beach Club aka EBC is one of the best day clubs you can go to. One of the MAIN reasons why this is one of the best is that they actually have Gaming Tables. Most Day Clubs don't (actually, I don't think any other day clubs have gaming tables, with the exception of XS but that is a nightclub). So if you're a gambler like me, you're gonna want to go here. Also, If you're going to book a table, I recommend booking the Lilypads. Why? Its on the water so you can chill on your Lilypad and hang out in the water. Best of both worlds in my opinion! You can't order food from your Lilypad but you can order food from the grill and BRING it to your lilypad. So you're good! If you're going to book any tables at EBC, make sure you go through a reputable promoter. I HIGHLY recommend booking with the EBC VIP host Brian Pfeiffer (773) 459-8133 - His cell phone. Just text him! He is AMAZZZINNNGG. He will walk you in, he will make sure you're all good and he will answer all your questions. Just went to Vegas this past weekend and had a blast.","Lilypads"

The ambiance is welcoming (literally, with the chefs and servers acknowledging every patron's entrance with a warm greeting, as per Japanese tradition), and it never gets too busy or over-crowded, so there's no reason to awkwardly wait around ever. It's a good place for a first date, not only because sushi's romantic like that, but because it's never too startlingly quiet or loud. There's just enough going on in this restaurant to keep everyone interested without being obnoxiously distracting.  Since the space isn't very large, there's usually only one server on duty, but they always somehow manage to be attentive to all tables. One thing out of the ordinary is that I've always had to ask for the bill, or pay directly at the cashier. If not, I could be waiting for hours before my server would offer to bring it over.  The fish is always fresh and inventive. My favorite is the sashimi salad. It's my all time favorite, the vinaigrette is a perfect tartness in contrast with thin strips of salmon, tuna, octopus, and mackerel. I could eat it forever. Other menu items are always cute and beautifully presented. There are even local nods to the Flames, with the 'Red Mile Roll,' and 'Red Hot Flames Rolls.'   I give Sushi Dining Chopsticks a 5-star rating for being an overall awesome dinner destination.","sushi, sashimi salad"

It's a great before/after show restaurant. We had a reservation and were seated right away after checking in with the hostess. The restaurant is open, so you can see the bar, kitchen, and casino floor.  I ordered the special that night, which was pappardelle pasta, a chunky tomato sauce, shredded lamb, kale, truffle-infused breadcrumbs, and freshly shredded parmesan. I was torn between several items on the menu, but I wanted a special since I was in Vegas for the weekend. It was phenomenal! I rarely eat lamb, and this was delicious. It was incredibly tender and tasted delicious. The sauce was very thick, almost like tomato chunks, but I didn't even feel like I was eating a tomato sauce. The balance of sauce, meat and kale was absolutely perfect.  I also had their moscow mule. Cocktails were expensive, so I decided to go for one that was all alcohol. Others in our group had several cocktails that were all extremely tasty. Additionally, I tried a few bites of what my friends had. I had a bite of the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatball melts in your mouth, and the sauce was phenomenal. The linguini and clams came in the most decadent white wine sauce with perfectly prepared clams. The french onion soup was rich, buttery, and tasted phenomenal.   They brought us a chocolate cheesecake as the complimentary birthday dessert and wrote ""Happy Birthday"" in raspberry sauce. The cheesecake had chocolate drizzled on top and edible pearls garnishing the plate. The waiter said it was always a surprise as to what the chef prepared for the complimentary birthday dessert.  Yes, this restaurant is pricey (although not by Vegas standards). However, you will have an excellent meal and receive spectacular service. The waiter took excellent care of us. He was really funny and made sure everything came out perfectly. The bussers constantly refilled water and ensure we had everything we needed.

Yes it might just be rice and steamed greens but their sauces enhance everything.  When I come for healthy vegan food, that's all I really want. I don't care for the vegetables to be made into unrecognizable too small, creative portions.

At 9PM the line to get into the buffet was still pretty insane.  Thank goodness for line pass!  Saturday is their ""gourmet"" buffet and you get some extras like beef wellington (pretty good) and lamb chops.  There are also selections of venison and prime rib but both were incredibly bad and overcooked or RAW, not rare.  I've never seen snow crab at the B buffet so I'm guessing they were new.  They also had the usual king crab legs but both the king and snow were partially frozen and TINY.  I'm sure if our party had gone earlier, we would have been able to get the bigger, more meaty ones but oh well.  For a first timer, the buffet would be good but coming back to eat again would be really difficult to justify the $40+ price tag.  Even on a comp, I would probably prefer to have an enjoyable more peaceful meal at the CAFE!","beef wellington, lamb chops, venison, prime rib, snow crab, king crab legs"

BUT, we did end up dropping a ton of cash.  If you read the reviews carefully, you'll notice that the people who had the best time are usually the ones who bought a lily pad, or a couch area.  It was a $500 minimum for the couch area by the blackjack tables, but I'm telling you that it was 100% worth it!  We had a bottle of Vodka and ordered some food and it was yummy :)  There was one UGLY thing about this place though which is why I removed 1 star, and that is that they don't allow ""oversized"" bags or backpacks and force you to check them for $20!!  $20!!!!  It's insane!  It really pissed off our group at first cause there were 2 of us with big bags, but at least they let us put them together for $20 total.  Jerks.....  I'm sure there's some good reason for not having oversized bags, but they didn't tell us.  One other messed up thing that happened is that we were approached by a promoter the night before after leaving XS and he offered us free admission AND a cabana for free.  We were like, hell yes!!  And then we we get to Encore Beach, the guy isn't around and no one would help us and we were stuck paying for the spot ourselves.  We were pretty pissed about that too, but we didn't let it ruin our time and got over it and just ended up paying.  OK, back to the good about this place:  The people are VERY friendly.  Everyone's there to have a good time!  We talked to lots of people and the couple next to us on the couch were awesome!  Overall we just had sooooo much fun!  Great music, dancing in the pool and at our area.  It would not have been as much fun if we didn't pay for that space though.  So suck it up and pay or else stay at your hotel pool (which was also awesome at Aria).","none"

Probably some of  the worst service I have received. At least if you are running behind or food is taking awhile, you come back and explain and/or apologize. Instead, we were left wondering and waiting for our food. Obviously that never came until we said we were going to leave and take it with us. You would think at that point they would have apologized or taken something off the check, but no, nothing. Chances are, I won't be back.

This isn't a 5 star restaurant... it's a decent buffet where you can try a little or a lot of everything. It's just fun, and a lot cheaper than those fancy chef name places in the hotels. Oysters,  crab, all kinds of fish and shellfish and lobsters. They have all of this and lots of veges and other dishes.

It's simple. It's priced fair and the waffle was very good. Sunday was my day to say I have had enough of the twigs and berries and I want pancakes! Well at least a waffle although they have big banner that states now serving pancakes but really who goes to a Waffle Cafe for pancakes...the name tells you what their specialty is.   Anyway I had a waffle with blueberries, strawberries and bananas. No I passed on the chocolate chips, whipped cream and powdered sugar. Hey I was breaking lose on my food choices but didn't want to go crazy...maybe that why I was carving ribs later that night because I knew I had saved some food karma points :)  Also the staff in this place was very friendly, helpful and fun. It was good to hear youthful energy enjoying their work instead of the normal this is just my job type of employee's. This staff gave good service and enjoyed what they do.    I would definitely come back here good food, good service and fair prices. Oh and I forgot to mention they also have cool smoothies I got the Lychee...yum I love the fruit!","waffles, pancakes"

We had a reservation for 9pm Saturday. When we arrived our table wasn't ready yet but the host asked if we wanted drinks and took our drink orders. There is no drink menu here - the staff is the drink menu- which was nice. Everyone is very knowledgeable and quick with recommendations.  Our party was big so we were seated outside on the patio which was enclosed and heated.  The menu changes a lot apparently and there is also a pretty big specials menu. For apps we got oysters, a sea urchin (from the specials menu), the foie gras terrine (from the specials menu), and the veal tartare. Everything was incredible and pairings were perfect. For example the bread that came with the foie gras was completely different than the toast served with the veal tartare which was completely different than the bread we were served with butter and pickles while we were waiting for our starters.  For dinner everyone got the lobster spaghetti. The portion was way big enough for two after apps and it was incredibly rich between the sauce, bacon and huge lobster chunks. Each order of the pasta comes with half a lobster.  Every wine pairing we tried was amazing.  Unfortunately we had no room for dessert but the meal was definitely above out expectations.   Expect to be here for a while. Our reservation was at 9 and we only finished eating at 11:37- and we're not slow eaters. I think the wait had to do with our party being big and the rest of the place being packed","sauce"

My husband and I along with our boys were in SC last weekend for scheduled maintenance on one of our SUV's and since the appointment was so early we rushed out without breakfast so of course the entire time in the waiting area we were searching for food.  This place was bookmarked by me so we went to check it out after seeing the menu had Vegan options and our boys and I are Vegan.  We arrived and Boy was this place busy, people standing outside waiting for tables and all. I went in to see how the list worked and there was a sheet of paper on the landing with no one manning it and several sets of people in the extremely small (6ppl capacity) entry way. I flagged down a server who then came to take my name and others waiting name down and explained to us all at once how the long table in the middle worked. Basically the table is 1st come 1st served and adding your name to the list put you on wait for the tables around the room on the outer perimeter. We were told 30min so we sat in the car and my husband went inside every 10mins to see if we were coming up since they don't take numbers nor do they have buzzers. I totally don't mind this process at all it seems more down to earth and not commercial.  After about 40 plus minutes we got a table and were so hungry and I ordered the chef special vegan dish which was the only Vegan dish on the list. I was immediately told that the chef special was SOLD OUT and that happened about a half hour before I ordered (meaning if we had a seat I wouldn't got to have it ). Mind you it was only like 11:30am *insert Kanye shrug*   I read on the specials menu that there was a skillet with lots of yummy veggies that I enjoy and some type of meat, I asked if the skillet could be made for me minus the meat. The waitress agreed so that's what I ordered. My husband ordered a veggie egg while omelet dish with a sweet potato waffle. Our toddler had pancakes and fruit.   Look I'm honest so here is the run down on what you we had:  Skillet (cauliflower, squash, sweet potato & red peppers) - This  we super tasty but extremely small. Egg white omelet with veggies(Goid) Sweet potato waffle - Hubby wasn't impressed he stated it was to soft and the texture wasn't what he expected.  We look forward to checking out other items and won't come hungry","Skillet, Goid, Sweet potato waffle"

Hubski and I shared a veggie sandwich and a peach pie thing. Tasty, but most definitely overpriced. The iced tea was tasty and refreshing, but still, sharing a meal with a drink each, it should have been less money. I'll go back for the ambiance.

That looks interesting.""  So I made a note to check it out on Yelp later.  After reading the reviews I channeled Liz Lemon and exclaimed, ""$6 vegetarian Indian food? I want to go to there!""  So that is how we wound up at Rani's.  I immediately went to the counter and ordered a thali and paneer paratha (I'm a sucker for paneer), and the cute lil lady behind the counter proceeded to give me an Indian sweet to have while I waited.  She brought out our thali, which consisted of 2 roti, rice, dal, pickles, okra, an aloo-gobi-type yumminess, and I believe kofta (veggie dumplings).  The cute lil lady was feeling generous and also gave us a tomato soup with paneer in it.  Definite bonus points.  Everything was fantastic, although I was expecting a little more paneer flavor to my paratha.  This place is very casual, which I really like about it.  Don't come in expecting the same food that you would get at a sit-down Indian restaurant; instead, expect the kind of food you would get if you were invited to a grandma's kitchen.  After we filled our bellies, we wandered through the aisles of the immaculately clean grocery store.  I hadn't planned on buying anything, but when I found garam masala for super cheap, and black salt that I had been looking for everywhere and couldn't find, and a giant bag of arrowroot powder for a couple bucks (normally $6-$12 for a tiny jar anywhere else)....well you get the picture.  Anything you would need for a well-stocked Indian pantry is here, and then some.    There's also mint and tamarind sauces, bottled lassis, naan, and huge blocks of paneer.  Trust me when I say I seriously considered buying all the above to snack on at home.  I considered giving this place 4 stars, because we went back a couple days later and the food was cold and missing that extra special love like we had the first time.  But it was a Friday evening and there was an Indian soap opera on the TV I think we interrupted....So, obviously, I can't blame them.","none"

It was one of the best brunches I had ever eaten.  Alas, my most recent trip did not make nearly as stellar an impression.  I brought my mother here for her birthday dinner last month, wanting to share with her the wondrous buffet I remembered.    Well, we got off to a bad start.  My son fell asleep in the car on the way over (he's five and had been in the pool all day) and I carried him into the restaurant.  At the register, I discovered that there was no children's price and that I would be paying more than $30 to enter with my sleeping child.  Because it was mom's birthday, I went with it, but I was annoyed.  No child is going to eat $30 worth of buffet food. They want the pizza and dessert and not much else.  Of course he didn't want to wake up at all and refused to eat much of anything, so I paid for him to sit there and be cranky.  My bad.  As for the adult meals, the food was fine.  I had prime rib, which was only OK, but the mashed potatoes were awesome.  My mother had the crab legs which she loved.  We must have sampled every dessert they served and each one was better than the last.  The waitress was kind of lazy and had to be waved down to refill our water.    Really the food was pretty good, so maybe it is just my son's behavior that's coloring my opinion on our meal,  but I just can't help but feel like we over paid.  There was nothing remarkable offered.  The service was iffy, the food was unexceptional.  Well, dessert was pretty great, but I don't need to pay almost $100 for my family to eat dessert.  I'm just not feeling the love for this place this time.","dessert"

I'm not entirely sure when this place opened but I knew it was fairly new. Either way, I ordered the San Francisco Benedict. The atmosphere and everything seemed great. When my food arrived and I took a bite, I realized I had been given the wrong dish as this one was called the Sandi Benedict and had spinach in it. It wasn't a huge deal to me. I really just wanted avocado, so I let the waitress know I had been given the wrong plate. She said she'd fix it and went to the back. I decided to stop eating as I wasn't sure if they were just bringing avocado or if they were bringing a whole plate out. After about 5 minutes of my boyfriend eating and me waiting, a manager came over and asked if everything was okay. I replied that yes as the waitress said she was handling it. Another 5-10 go by and I hadn't heard anything. I was hungry and now my food was cold so I just started eating it. Finally, the waitress comes out and asks if the manager handled my issue. I told her that I told the manager she was handling it. She ran off to figure it out I guess. I ate my cold food and was very unhappy. The manager came over later and apologized and told me that the waitress hit the wrong item on the tablet and they are so busy with trainees that it was chaotic. She gave me a $13 voucher and did not charge me for my meal. She assured me that it isn't normally like that, so I accepted this and planned to return in the future. I would like to mention that the food was good, but the experience wasn't.  I returned just this last Saturday intending to use the voucher and give them go #2. We had a young male server this time. He was nice and polite. I asked him how their herbal tea is (as that is all it was listed as on menu) and he said he hadn't tried it but knows it's some sort of seasonal harvest blend. I agreed to try it. When he brought it and ran off, I noticed he brought me coffee. I waited for him to come back around. I'm really trying at this point to give this place a chance but it was striking out again already. When he finally returned I clarified that I asked for tea, to which he said he thought I asked for coffee and he said he'd bring the tea. When the tea came, the water in the pot was basically almost room temperature. It was just lukewarm. I was sort of done trying so I just lived with it. I ordered the same thing I intended to have the last time. When the food finally came, my hash browns were nice and hot, but the eggs were again room temperature. Not even the slightest bit warm. I didn't complain. I just ate my cold food and made the decision I won't be returning any time soon. Again, the food is good (Should be at least warm) but my experiences here have not been the best. Maybe I'll give this place a year or so to get things together before returning. I've never been anywhere where I have had back to back not so great experiences. I gave it 2 stars for the food being okay alone.","tea"

(You are old like me if you know that theme song!)  Have you ever gone to a restaurant with great expectations based on reviews and left disappointed?  That was our experience.  Some call it cozy but for me the table layout in the main dining room is claustrophobically cramped.  If you want a seat on the patio on Friday or Saturday in the summer, make sure to reserve several days in advance.  Reservations are taken by phone and I will admit they were very helpful even if it did take 10 rings for them to answer... I was surprised that a restaurant in this price range did not have online reservations!  Being in a house transformed into a restaurant, the entry hallway is narrow, so if someone is going out, nobody can go in and vice versa.    So if you are even a little claustrophobic,  be warned, you won't be comfortable here.    The food:  Complimentary bruschetta:  A plain Pizza crust with bruschetta topping which falls off and wasn't that flavourful. Go to La Bruschetta to find out how it is meant to taste.  Caesar salad:  Crispy romaine, hints of fresh garlic and Parmesan but the dressing seemed watery and the croutons were like rocks.  Bread basket:  Now I know why the croutons are like rocks, the crust on the bread was so hard I was worried I would break a tooth, and I also found it strange to be served whole wheat bread, when I was expecting crusty Italian bread.    Spaghetti Carbonara:   The reason we came was because Hubby was craving Carbonara and based on great reviews we thought we would try it here but he found Fieramosca's version disappointingly bland, even with extra Parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper.    Linguini DI Mamma Ninetta:  I love mushrooms but was surprised that there were so many in this dish... With just 3 small shrimp and a few small pieces of chicken scattered throughout, and very little garlic flavour, this dish was edible but far from great.  Tiramisu:  No coffee flavour!  I have made Tiramisu before and have had it in countless restaurants and I know the lady fingers are to be dipped in coffee before being covered in cream, and these missed the coffee altogether, and the cream here seemed to just be whipped cream, none of the yummy marscapone that I was expecting.   Libretto's Tiramisu in a jar might not be traditional in presentation but has all the flavour that Fieramosca's lacked.  My favourite dessert when done well, I left disappointed.  Lemon Sorbet:  Frozen sorbet in a scooped out lemon, menu says imported from Italy.  I actually liked it better than the sad face Tiramisu so hubby swapped with me because while he usually loves anything lemon, he found an odd aftertaste.  I joked it was the jet fumes to bring frozen sorbet from Italy but the truth is, it was the perfume worn by the woman at the table next to ours.  Thankfully she arrived as we had dessert, so our entire meal was not ruined, but the smell was so overpowering that it gave us both a headache and we wanted to get out of there fast, since with the cramped layout she was almost on top of our table.  Ladies, please don't drown yourself in perfume and go to a restaurant!  Ugh!  TL;DR - Meh. Bottom line nothing was horrible but nothing was great, which for the price was disappointing.  Not worth a second visit.  2 stars bumped to 3 because the service was good.  The search for Pasta Carbonara continues... maybe a trip to NYC or even Rome!","Complimentary bruschetta, kenon tulokset, Spaghetti Carbonara, Linguini DI Mamma Ninetta, Tiramisu, Lemon Sorbet"

Their menu looked amazing!  They have an ""award winning"" four cut burger--which I will try next time!  Dessert was delish!  We had the doughnut holes and Kelly's twinkie.  Both were excellent!   I was most impressed with the service!  We were greeted right away.  While we were eating our dessert both a manager and the chef stopped by to check on us.  I was most impressed that the chef and manager cared so much about our experience!  A+ service!  I'm glad I found this new gem in Old Town Scottsdale!

Definitely not bad or awful, but maybe if I sandwiched a later supper  between undulating bare bellied vixens and a couple of Kingfishers, I'd stumble out with a hazier (and happier ) overall impression.    Nothing I've ever eaten here was truly bad enough to take back - or savory enough to inspire a return visit. Portions tend to be small and sauces are, by and large, mild and rather one dimensional.  Other than the garlic naan, I cant  remember a dish smelling really awesome as it wafted by, which is a shame considering Indian cuisine is among the world's most aromatic.     I was eager to share yesterday's lamb boti kabob, as the portion was good sized - about 15-20 small cubes of lamb (not mega kabob sized cubes, but a very respectable portion for $10-11), on the usual tandoori bed of onions and peppers.  The lamb exterior was nice & crusty, but the inside wasnt moist and tender like you'd expect from tandoori - instead it was hard, chewy and disappointing.  Companion's entree was 3 tiny vegetable fritters or dumplings buried in a thick sauce, that looked more like an appetizer.  Chicken dishes are generally better - the tandoori version is good, and similar to most Indian joints.  I recommend the three hot relishes (red sauce, green puree, and pickled peppers) provided tableside, as house preparations, at least in my experience, tend to be mild.   Servers are generally Anglo, pleasant and competent during the meal, but just about every time we walk in for dinner at 5 or 5:30, the entire operation seems almost startled by our presence. Nobody's overtly rude, but instead of a really warm welcome, you kind of get four or five employees hanging out at the bar staring at you, as if mentally choosing straws to see who has to deal with the first dinner customer of the evening. It's not oppressive, but it's happened more than once and I'm not crazy about the vibe.    I do like the complimentary, self serve chai tea and open kitchen, providing an opportunity to stretch one's legs and socialize a bit. Nice touches.   The menu is extensive, all told about sixty items, and reasonably priced for Indian food. Indian textiles, jewelry and artwork is often on display, for sale, and the house music is too loud if you have the misfortune to be seated under a ceiling speaker. It got turned down, eventually, but any restaurant with a few years under it's belt ought to understand customary American tolerances better than that.    The atmosphere is up and down. Food's OK. Service is OK. Ask my family and they'll each give it four or five stars. In my book, Tandoori Times is just OK.","garlic naan, lamb boti kabob,tandoori bed of onions and peppers,vegetable fritters,hot relishes"

The guacamole (made to your specs at the table) is delicious and its pretty much all my 4 year old eats there.  I normally get the tacos, either brisket or fish and they're really great, though I'm not a fan of mango salsas in general.   Last night we had the guac and a couple of Wednesday special margaritas which were just right.  We thought the chips tasted a little stale though and the small bowl, coupled with distracted waitstaff, became empty quickly. My wife and I split the main dish, which was a special ""baked brisket enchilada"" recommended by the waitress.  It was huge and definitely more than enough for too, but we didn't care for it. There didn't seem to be much beef in it; it was mostly sauce and cheese.  It will be awhile before we go again, and I think we'll stick to the tacos when we do. In summary, lots to like here, but I'd say stick to the basics.","GUACAMOLE,MANGO SALSAS, BAKED BRISKET ENCHILADA,"

It stands for ""hand ball"" or the like and are rice balls either stuffed, mixed or topped with various ingredient combinations.   In sum it adds up to this; too expensive for the lack of quality ingredients in the 4 balls themselves. The photos are quite misleading and in the case of the crispy lobster balls is virtually faux...where's the beef comes to mind...pretty much lobster rillettes at best.

He was genuinely interested in feedback and his passion for cooking and providing a great experience for his customers was very evident.  I recommend everyone stop in and give this place a try.  It is now on my list of regular lunch spots when I am on the N. Side.","CHICAGO, CHEDDAR, GRILLED"

Best bet is to park in the parking garage and then go to the walking mall.  Even so, it's tough to find.  Don't give up.  Also, it is no longer Fuego Tacos, but now Fuego del Mar, with a seafood-centric menu.    That being said.  I was pretty edgy by the time we arrived.  We're from Cave Creek and had been out shopping and then had a heck of a time finding the place, so we arrived about 8.15---pretty close to closing.  And I had a Groupon---and there are Yelp reviews that said the staff DOESN'T like Groupon-ers.  Greeted by guy that I assume is the gent someone described as ""XL"".  He's just a little round.  And was a warm, welcoming fella.  He beamed a smile at us, waved at dining room and told us to sit wherever we wanted.  We chose a cozy booth in the corner.  Our server was there in moments with menus and take our drink orders.  I wish I remembered her name---dark hair in a pony-tail, glasses, and really personable and nice despite it being the end of the night and we were late-comers.    Nice ambiance---exposed brick walls, soft light, great music---DH would have liked their playlist!  TROUBLE: she hands us the menu.  Except for one dish, everything is seafood.  Fuego Tacos is now Fuego del Mar.  DH doesn't like fish and is semi-allergic to shellfish.  I asked if he wanted to leave, and he said no, we had gone thru too much to find the place---he would just order the one non-seafood dish.  At least he didn't have to make a lot of choices!  So DH ordered the Pernil Asada, which was described as slow-cooked pork topped with mango-chile salsa.  His sides were the Green Chile-Bacon Hushpuppies and the Latin Succotash.  I ordered their signature dish of Seafood Chile Rellenos---a poblano pepper stuffed with shrimp, crab and tilapia in a lobster-tomato sauce with hush puppies and Pineapple-Serrano Cole Slaw.  For drinks, DH got the house red and I got a Pomegranate Adult Lemonade.  Drinks arrived in less than 5 minutes.  DH very happy with something he thought would be bottom row plonk.  My Adult Lemonade was SO delicious---I had to be careful!  I could have drank several of them.  It tasted like lemonade with a hint of fruit---but it definitely had alcohol in it!  Entrees arrived within 15 minutes of the drinks.  DH's was all on one plate.  Three hush puppies, Latin Succotash---which looked delish---and a mound of pork with the salsa.  Not super pretty.  My presentation was much more beautiful---a mammoth poblano pepper in a puddle of light red sauce.  Slaw and hush puppies on the side.  Lovely presentation.  My only comment is that serving something in a bowl (albeit large) that needs to be cut is problematic.  I'd like to say how wonderful DH's meal was, but basically I got one bite of his pork---that's all he would share---before he devoured it.  He said it was one of the best pork dishes he had ever enjoyed.  He felt like he was in the Caribbean!  I got no bites of the Succotash, darn him---looked so good!  He scarfed it all!   His hush puppies went that fast too!  Was my seafood Chile Relleno the best thing EVER?  No, but it was VERY, VERY GOOD!  Beautifully cooked, not greasy,  seafood not overcooked at all, the lobster-tomato sauce was delicious.  Again, only quibble I have is serving it in a bowl.  It was a very deep bowl too---a smaller girl might have had trouble reaching in there, but I am fairly tall and long-armed.  The hush puppies---shut my mouth, darlin', but they were dang good!  Lots of lovely, bacon-y flavor, a hint of heat, and a touch sweet.  What is it with those Yankees not adding a bit of sweet to their cornbread?  Whoever made these knew what they were doing.  The Pineapple-Serrano Cole Slaw was in a citrus-y, non-creamy dressing and the crispness, the fruitiness and the heat was a perfect counterpoint to the richness of the Relleno.  Huge portion---I ended up bringing home half the Relleno, Slaw and two hush puppies---LUNCH!  YUM!  DH swined his plate so it's deli turkey for him, hahaha!  Bonus---ended up talking to the gentleman in the booth next to us---so interesting.  He is a musician who's lived all over the US and the world---Europe and the Middle East.  Really neat guy.  I wouldn't live in the City, but I love visiting the City 'cause you meet the most interesting people!  So at the end, I pulled out my Groupon and gave it to our server, apologizing that I had ""hid"" it until the end, but that Yelp reviews had indicated Groupon-ers got short shift as far as service went.  She took it graciously with a smile and said one of the issues was when they were Fuego Tacos, people ordered $9 plates than proferred a $10 Groupon.  Not nice.  (BTW, Fuego del Mar entrees from $20-$25) For sure, we will be back.  It's a field trip for us, but worth it.  Just an all-around good experience.","Ritz Carleton,Fuego Tacos"

I was out with my sister when we realized we were hungry, and were in the mood to have a beer or glass or wine with dinner, I couldn't remember if Doan's was serving yet so I called while on the road and a woman informed me they do sell beer and wine, but not liquor. Worked for us. My sister is also a vegetarian and although I couldn't remember if I saw a veg section in the menu, we did find one online so we figured we were safe, and then we arrived... First, our waitress informed us they don't serve alcohol yet. Um, okay? After a ridiculous wait to get someones attention to ask if they had a veg menu supplement, we were informed by a waiter that they used to, but have since chucked it. Great. Unfortunately he was unwilling to point us in any direction or give us any veg friendly options. Okay, back to the menu.  I ordered the rocket shrimp and the bun with chik/pork/springrolls (after they informed me they don't serve the banh xeo listed on their menu). My sister ended up ordering the wonton soup with tofu/veg and the tofu/veg pad thai. My food was fine, but for her, she ended up with a plain wonton soup and the seafood pad thai. If it hadn't taken so long to get the first round of food she would have sent it back, and the waitress was very grateful she didn't want to send it back and that she agreed to pick around the seafood and eat the dish. My sister then asked for a few steamed veggies on the sides to supplement the lack of vegetables in her pad thai, the waitress agreed without issue.   Everything seemed okay, though the veggies arrived in a completely different sauce, but when we got the bill I was a little surprised. Not only did we have to pay for the seafood pad thai that we clearly did not order (and all the seafood was left stacked on the side of the plate), we also had to pay for the side of vegetables! seriously?? It was only a few dollars more in the end, but included with the lack of service (in a fairly empty restaurant), there are just better places in town to get great tasting Vietnamese food with better service. Sorry Doan's, maybe next time.","beef broth ,Vietnamese food"

There's plenty of famous tables (LOTR, Addams Family, Ripley's) that have had color conversions too. All tables are well cared for and while there's always a handful of tables that are broken they seem to actually fix them. Ample parking and low table prices. $5 or $10 bucks will get you plenty of play time. It's not walkable from the strip, but a cab or Lyft wouldn't be too expensive as you're just to the east.

Some blue cheese, french fries, Texas toast. Not to mention, a drink! You get a lot. I did get a little side order of carrots, but it wasn't expensive at all.  Today, we were feeding the wonderful volunteers that are remodeling our church. They are so kind & generous for devoting their free time to our church. So, I placed an order for the 30 wings special. I ordered it ahead of time and it was ready when I got there. Everything was there. And, I really like the way that they separated the cold items and put them in a separate bag.  Everybody loved the wings including myself. I will definitely continue coming here either for the lunch special just for myself or if in the future, there will be another party, I will definitely get their large wings special deal again! I really love their wings! They are perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned. Plus, they have the best customer service!","6 wing combo, side of carrots,"

The food is no longer anything special, and the service can be downright hostile. The last two times we've eaten here, our server (older middle-aged woman wearing way too much perfume) was very rude. Most recently, she made us wait 10 minutes before she came to our table, even though we were the only ones in the restaurant!   She asked if we wanted menus (who asks that question?), then literally fewer than 3 seconds later, asked if we were ready to order. I could feel the animosity radiating from her. We tipped less than 10%, and this still was overly generous. I used to be a waiter, and have only tipped less than 20% in 2 restaurant visits - this is out of probably thousands of visits.   The food is now bland and tastes like fast food Chinese. Even the chicken coconut soup doesn't taste right, and that was their best dish.   It's a damn shame; this used to be one of my favorite restaurants. I'm guessing it was bought by somebody who simply doesn't care, and that attitude is reflected by the staff.   The good ratings here are probably remnants of old visits - I would stay far, far away from this restaurant.","chicken coconut soup,"

The white meat was well cooked, moist on the inside, the portion of sauce to meat was perfect and the sauce was seasoned with all of the right ingredients making it so creamy.

We used the Yelp check in offer for a free entree with the purchase of a drink which is an awesome way to try something new. It was also ocean day insulated bag day which is really nice and will be used when grocery shopping this summer or transporting hot food to keep it warm.   We had a chimicurri steak burrito with chips as well as a cabo platter which is a burrito and taco. The steak burrito was really good because of the chimicurri sauce which had a refreshing and light taste. The shrimp burrito that came with the platter wasn't as good as it was heavier on the rice and beans so it didn't feel like it had enough shrimp but the taco made up for it. The drinks they have are different and refreshing too, I had a pomegranate lemonade by odowalla that uses real sugar instead of corn sryup.   I really recommend going to Rubios for a lighter refreshing meal, try the fish tacos and sign up for their club for emails on special offers.","drink,chimicurri steak burrito,chips,chimicurri sauce,shrimp burrito,corn sryup,fish tacos"

What a beautiful spot and a great ambience.  We were greeted by a couple friendly hostesses and shown to an indoor table as the patio was full.  We got a great spot by the window that opened, so a great compromise. The experience.  The menu did not have a lot of lunch options (brunch was the focus of the day) and the ones that were offered were somewhat difficult to figure out.  Frustrated I ordered the bison burger and my wife had the flatbread.  The food came quickly enough (wasn't busy) but that is where it all went awry.  The bison burger was small yet I could not finish it as there was a strange flavour to it that made it sickening after a while.  The potato salad that accompanied it was good. The flat bread was not good.  There must have been something wrong with it as it had a sweet but pungent smell (and taste) to it.  We are not ones to complain but when the server finally returned (no quality check, and did not see her until we were done with the place) my wife mentioned it was a little weird. The server did concur that something seemed off and promptly took the item off the bill which was appreciated, but also expected as it was not edible. Overall I am glad we went because we had been wondering about this place but I would be very hesitant to go back.","bison burger, flatbread, potato salad"

I ordered what I've always ordered. A bean burrito, a taco and a drink. It cost over $9 dollars!! The lady didn't tell me a price in the drive through which is annoying because they don't have a screen that tells you. She asked if I wanted a bean and cheese burrito. Well obviously I said yes I want cheese in it. The price on the menu said it was like $2.50. There was no mention of cheese in my burrito costing more. So I pull up to the window and she tells me it will be $9.40 or whatever. I said, I'm sorry how much?? So I'm sitting there doing my own math and it still didn't add up. $2.09 for a drink, $2 something for the taco and $2 something for the burrito. Even with tax there was absolutely no way that it would have added up to that much. So I get the receipt and they charged me $4.58 for a burrito!! There sign said $2 something. I pulled around and went in and their price inside said $3 something for the burrito. I went up and asked why I was overcharged $4.58 for a burrito. He said because I got cheese in it. I said, your burritos don't come with cheese in them??? They always have and I've never been charged extra for it!! What place doesn't put cheese in a burrito?? Also, for the first time their taco was bad. I opened the box and the taco shell was wet and soggy!! Usually it's nice and crispy/crunchy and this time was not. I told them their signs are wrong. Also that it's ridiculous you charge that much for a burrito with cheese!! Told them I will never be back!! I can get better food at Taco Bell and more food for the same price!! They don't false advertise there either! Furious!  Their food and prices have gone downhill fast! They lost mine and my family's business for good!!","bean burrito, taco"

At our table we had a chicken sandwich, a sausage and pepper hoagie, and a pork chop. The chicken was reported as good (wasn't mine), the pork was Ok but not out of this world, and the sausage was messy but good - had marinara sauce on it which was unexpected. The mac and cheese was a little greasy but pretty good.  As for the ""biker bar"" label.. I saw about 2 bikers and the rest of the crowd was regular peeps.

Sheesh, how embarrassing.   Beyond the (yes, I do realize it was intentional) misspelling of the name of the restaurant, Lucki Thai doesn't miss on many marks for me.  I've had the opportuniti to dine in, get carri out, and order deliveri (I'll stop this now) from Lucki on many occasions in the last few months, so I can tell you that no matter which method you decide to go with for your thai food fix there you won't be disappointed.  The first time I had Lucki I dined in and had the Tom Yum soup with Shrimp and their Crab Fried rice.  The Tom Yum Soup is consistently good, and I'd know since it's been a staple of every single order I've made with Lucki since.  It's always hot, with the perfect combination of sour and spicy, and loaded with mushrooms and an ample amount of shrimp.  The large order feeds 2 perfectly.  The crab fried rice is not something I tend to order, but Lucki's version definitely packed a lot of crab flavor.   They also weren't shy with the egg on the rice, and being an egg slut like Anthony Bourdain, that pleased me.  I've done a mix of delivery and take-out many times since, and every time the delivery is at the house by the promised time (usually well before), and the food has almost always been ready to go when I arrive for a carry-out order.    Of the items I've ordered those times, the curries have been phenomenal, as has the spicy eggplant entree.   I wish I could explain what makes the eggplant there stand out over other places that I've had similar dishes, but I usually gobble it up so fast there's no time for me to remember any particulars about the dish other than it's absolutely delectable.  I'm also a huge fan of their brown rice option, even though it's $2 extra.   Lucki's brown rice is one of the only in the city that I feel is worth whatever upcharge they want for it.   I'm pretty sure it's not just brown rice but a mix of wild and brown rice.   I also really liked the Rad Na, though my laziness knows no bounds in that I felt like it was a lot of work eating it.   It's truly shameful.     The only order I wasn't completely thrilled with so far was the Beef Pad See Ewe.  The flavors were nice, but the beef was tough and chewy.   A simple misstep which I can forgive.  I have to admit I almost gave 4 stars instead of 5 for the only thing that has gotten on my nerves a bit with Lucki Thai thus far:   spice consistency.   I started by ordering level 6 and 7 which is my normal go-to at other Thai joints, but didn't find them spicy enough.   I've now settled on an 8, which at most places would feel like it was burning a hole in my esophagus with each swallow.   Getting delivery a few weeks ago and ordering an 8, it had literally ZERO spice.  It actually might have gotten into the negatives.   It's quite frustrating because I suspect if I move into the 9-10 category the chef stops even paying attention and probably just dumps a whole barrel of ghost chiles into the pan.   WHAT'S MY NEXT MOVE HERE?  But alas, the service and food are simply too good even with that inconsistenci.  Sorry I couldn't resist.","Tom Yum soup with Shrimp and their Crab Fried rice, spicy eggplant, Beef Pad See Ewe"

I've done a mix of delivery and take-out many times since, and every time the delivery is at the house by the promised time (usually well before), and the food has almost always been ready to go when I arrive for a carry-out order.    Of the items I've ordered those times, the curries have been phenomenal, as has the spicy eggplant entree.   I wish I could explain what makes the eggplant there stand out over other places that I've had similar dishes, but I usually gobble it up so fast there's no time for me to remember any particulars about the dish other than it's absolutely delectable.  I'm also a huge fan of their brown rice option, even though it's $2 extra.   Lucki's brown rice is one of the only in the city that I feel is worth whatever upcharge they want for it.   I'm pretty sure it's not just brown rice but a mix of wild and brown rice.   I also really liked the Rad Na, though my laziness knows no bounds in that I felt like it was a lot of work eating it.   It's truly shameful.     The only order I wasn't completely thrilled with so far was the Beef Pad See Ewe.  The flavors were nice, but the beef was tough and chewy.   A simple misstep which I can forgive.  I have to admit I almost gave 4 stars instead of 5 for the only thing that has gotten on my nerves a bit with Lucki Thai thus far:   spice consistency.   I started by ordering level 6 and 7 which is my normal go-to at other Thai joints, but didn't find them spicy enough.   I've now settled on an 8, which at most places would feel like it was burning a hole in my esophagus with each swallow.   Getting delivery a few weeks ago and ordering an 8, it had literally ZERO spice.  It actually might have gotten into the negatives.   It's quite frustrating because I suspect if I move into the 9-10 category the chef stops even paying attention and probably just dumps a whole barrel of ghost chiles into the pan.   WHAT'S MY NEXT MOVE HERE?  But alas, the service and food are simply too good even with that inconsistenci.  Sorry I couldn't resist.","Crab Fried, Tom Yum Soup,egg slut,brown rice,ghost chiles"

Anyway, it's now a very very bright and colorful Mexican cafe.   Enchiladas with Boom Boom Sauce and Mango Margaritas were good. I think I'd like to come back in summer and sit on the huge patio. Really good Tres Leches cake too.  I just can't get over the interior though - I think the lighting is just SO BRIGHT, they would do themselves a favor to get a lighting scheme designer to come in and adjust things a bit - make it less of a cafeteria. It reminds me of a place in California - Chevy's... same sort of set up and theme.   Lots of families and kids. No sense of intimacy - so not a date spot for sure - a good casual place to chill after shopping at the Pottery Barn though..   The server we had was a little sleepy but he was nice. I think he needed a nap though.","Enchiladas with Boom Boom suace, Tres leches cake,"

Service was okay, but felt like I had to order and get out in record time. I ordered a Ruben and my husband ordered a corned beef sandwich. They should be ashamed of themselves with the quality of bread and corned beef that they serve. The cole slaw and potato salad tasted like they bought it packaged from Walmart or Sam's Club. There is nothing special about this place and I can make a better corned beef brisket at home, which isn't saying much. Skip this place. Sadly we still have to wait to get a good New York deli in Charlotte and surrounding.","sandwich"

Although this restaurant is priced high, in Vegas terms I would say it's average. The service, ambiance and location are exceptional and the food couldn't be more perfect. I usually have some sort of critique on what could be better, and this time all I can say is that if they could make the meal never end.   The best way to experience Milos is via their tasting menu. I started with their grilled octopus which is one of the best I've had (other than in Montreal of course). The flavor and texture of their octopus is just right and the portion perfect.   For my main I went with the lobster pasta, which was equally delicious as my starter and equally well executed. If I could eat this dish every day, I would.   Dessert was a baklava walnut cake topped with honey ice cream. Delicious and a perfect ending.   I can see why this restaurant is considered one of the best Mediterranean ones in the world - with locations in London, Athens, New York, Miami, Las Vegas and Montreal.","tasting menu, grilled octopus, lobster pasta, baklava walnut cake with honey ice cream"

The pros: The ambiance and decor are super cute. Like a dressed up farmhouse.  The food is good and very ""farm to table"" (that's so hot right now).  Good selection of cocktails.  Nice patio.  Open for lunch.   Cons: The prices are pretty high. For food that includes sandwiches and salads, you are paying in the teens for each dish. Drinks are equally expensive.  Service is hit and miss (from my 3 visits). They're friendly and all, but sometimes just seem to forget about things like clearing dishes or refilling drinks.   Bottom line: it's a cool place with good food, but I won't go again unless somebody else requests it.","SANDWICH, SALAD,DRINKS"

The pizza is pretty mediocre, but it's really cheap and convenient. The cheesy bread, subs, chicken fingers, and onion rings are pretty delicious. We always order online (which I love), it's right around the corner, delivery is always under 45 minutes (yes, we're that lazy and really hate winter), and the delivery people are always super nice. Sadly, they had to go and screw up the good thing we had going.   Last time we ordered it was for pick-up as 20 years of junk food ordering has taught me pick-up to takes half the time of delivery. We ordered cheesy bread, a Philly sub, and onion rings. I asked for ranch instead of marinara with the cheesy bread and requested ranch for the onion rings.  I paid in advance and added a 20% tip (on take-out) thinking that would help make up for any ""inconvenience"" or cost of my ranch requests (we ordered the exact same thing for delivery the previous time with absolutely no problem, by the way). My husband showed up about 20 minutes after I ordered. Not only wasn't the food ready, but apparently they hadn't even started it and were in no hurry. He waited almost another HOUR (seriously--from ordering til he got home was an hour fifteen and it's about a one minute drive) to get our food. They didn't comp or discount or offer any vouchers or coupons or anything.   When we opened our food there were no sauces of any kind. I'd waited a long time and was starving and pretty pissed about this oversight after all that. I hopped in the car because, as I said, it's literally around the corner, and junk food just ain't the same without ranch for dippin.   I walked in. Everyone was in the kitchen (no one at the counter), but I was clearly seen, though nobody shouted a greeting or ""I'll be right with you."" Finally a girl walked toward the front, though again not at a speed that anyone in the restaurant business should use. I told her my husband had just waited a ridiculously long time for our take-out order and when he got home there were no sauces, could I just have like six containers of ranch that we should have gotten with our order. Now that may have been an excessive amount, but I had low blood sugar brain. And at this point I figured they'd throw anything at me to appease a dissatisfied customer (because they'd screwed up!). Instead, she looked at the computer and said she needed to get the person who took the order. Why? I have no idea. But she said she was new, so I said fine. She went in to the kitchen to tell another girl who dropped what she was doing to go tell an older man, who I assume is the owner, most certainly the boss. Expecting him to greet me with a smile and an apology, or at least a how can I help you, I was taken aback to get a brusk questioning of who I was and what I ordered. He also needed to look it up on the computer for some godforsaken reason. It was like they all had amnesia! You don't remember the tall skinny dude who JUST left after waiting for his order for an hour?! He told me what I ordered like I was on crack and what was the problem. I said yes, I know what I ordered, but I requested ranch, and even added a generous tip in case he wanted to charge me for it. Again, he rudely asked me how many I wanted, incredulous I was asking. It was like the freakin inquisition. Do they have a problem with ranch robberies??? Are people always walking in and making up stories about how they didn't get ranch with their orders?? He started taking containers out of the fridge. I was so upset by this point that I don't even know what he said that prompted me say ""Wow, you are really something else."" There were four containers of ranch on the counter which I snatched while I could and turned around to walk out, at which point he yelled after me how they're 75 cents a piece. I may have muttered something in return as the door was closing behind me.   I honestly think this was the most disrespectful customer service I have ever received. It certainly tops the list as worst interaction/confrontation with a stranger. I can't believe anyone would treat or talk to anyone like that, let alone a proprietor to a customer. I worked in a restaurant for seven years and one of the cardinal rules is own up and apologize when you make a mistake--99% of the time people will completely understand. Offer them a discount or a freebie and the mistake is completely forgotten.  I realize no one cares or will ever read this. My husband has already chastised me for wasting my energy on it, but I was just so incredulous about the entire thing. It was cathartic. I feel better. Though that will be of little comfort next time I want cheesy bread (with ranch!) and have to order elsewhere.","none"

Ever since I went to Social House, I certainly changed my mind about going to Koi again!    My girl friend and I went to Social House last Saturday a little before 5, before the restaurant opened for dinner.  The host was very friendly and informed us that the restaurant was not opened for dinner yet.  My girl friend and I each had a a cocktail while we waited.  Wow! I loved their ""Socialite"" cocktail and my girlfriend was amazed by their ""lycheetini"".  Both drinks were incredible!! This definitely gave us a boost of confidence about the meal we were about to have.   When it was time for dinner we picked a bottle of sparkling sake called ""hana awaka""....it was sincerely the best sparkling sake we've ever had.  It was a little pricey (then again, what's not pricey in Vegas?) but it was definitely an amazing experience to try something new!   The food, oh the food was just so incredible.  My favorites were hamachi jalapeno, hamachi tartar, miso cod lettuce cups, and uni.  All of the dishes have nice portion since it's meant to be shared, which I thought was a great concept!  The food was just so fresh and nicely flavored we actually ordered some dishes again!  My girl friend and I were definitely in sushi heaven.    Everyone in the restaurant were extremely friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be working there.  The manager came to ask us twice to see if we were satisfied with the food and if we were having a good time.  My water never went below half empty as the water and busboy constantly refills it as soon as I drank some.  For someone who drinks a lot of water with my meal and so I'm constantly asking for more water, this is a huge plus for me.     The ambiance was amazing.  We enjoyed the trendy music but it was not too loud we couldn't hear our own conversation.   Overall, we had an incredible experience dining at social house.  It was such a fantastic meal my girl friend and I were still talking about it half an house after we walked out of the restaurant!  This is definitely one place we have to visit every time we go to Vegas!","hamachi jalapeno, hamachi tartar, miso cod lettuce cups and uni"

I respect small business owners that put in effort to follow up to feedback shared. After his note, I have gone back to the business and better understand what their focus areas are.   SUMMARY Cheese & Crackers primarily is an order ahead market. The name 'cheese and crackers' is misleading, as what they offer stretches beyond cheese. You can order a range of things like artisanal cheese trays, cured meats to seafood. The trick is to visit their website and sign up for their mailing list. There, you'll get a better feel for the range of products Cheese & Crackers offers on a weekly basis beyond what you just see in-store.   PROS: - Order Seafood: They have a mailing list to order fresh seafood. Sign up on their website. They bring in fresh, high quality seafood from Canada. I went to a dinner party that served fresh salmon from here - was delightful.  - Catering: They are a great fit for catering, in particular artisanal cheese platters and trays.  - Baguette Sandwiches To Go: They serve sandwiches on baguettes like thinly sliced roast beef. - Cheese Assortment: They have an extensive list of featured cheeses.  CONS:  - They don't offer in-store or to-go cheese plates - only order ahead. I would love to be able to stop by, select 3-4 cheeses, take them home to try that evening.  - They have a few bistro tables, but the store footprint is small thus it isn't really a spot to hang out in-store.  - The sandwiches are only served on baguettes, and the baguettes are really tough on your teeth / hard to bite. Would be nice to offer another bread option for sandwiches, as the sandwiches are very tasty.","Cheese,Crackers,Seafood,bread,sandwiches"

Arrogant, unprofessional, and ignorant. I ordered from grub hub and online they have spicy garlic listed as a dry rub. It came as a sauce. When I asked him the difference between a rub and a sauce he said I'm not going to answer any questions. Alvin stated this was grub hubs mistake even though they are a third party delivery service. He also changed the name of the smart mouthed hostess from Sabrina to brandy. I was advised to contact grub hub in regards to the confusion. Alvin was also rude to that employee stating he would not be doing anything to address the misconception. I was not looking for a freebie. I wanted them to correct their misleading menu.

Let me explain...  There are not many ""old"" restaurants in this town. We don't seem to value/frequent/patronize places that have been around putting out food for a long time. I think we should. Even when the food isn't show stopping. Why? This place has tremendous character and charm. There's an ""Old Western Vegas"" feel to Bob Taylor's. Established in 1955, it's the oldest restaurant in Las Vegas. Its a throwback to a rugged, carnivorous cowboy culture that has existed in this town for decades. And still exists. I did appreciate the slice of Vegas kitch that Bob Taylor's offers.   FOOD ISSUES: So with all that charm how could this place go wrong? This place could be great. It really should be great. But they are not putting enough care into the food. I ordered the rib eye and asked for it to be medium rare. I was worried about it being overcooked and figured if a mistake was made, I'd be in the medium range. My instincts were correct. But the steak was closer to well done. In total, three steaks at our table were seriously overcooked. In a steakhouse. With a man tasked with grilling the steaks. Sigh. The fourth steak, smoked prime rib, was cooked properly. But the prime rib is cooked ahead if time, right? How was I prepared for this overcooked piece of meat? How did this only occasional red-meat-eater suspect that my steak would not be treated with attentive care?   I'll tell you. When we walked in there was a large grill at the front of the restaurant with a number if steaks cooking on it. But the chef was not watching the meat. He wasn't even in front of the grill. He was nowhere to be seen as we walked through the doors. And there were at least 4 steaks cooking when we arrived. So I figured that my steak would receive the same lack of attention.    I ordered a simple naked potato and a side salad to accompany my steak. Both were fine. But there is not much room to mess up a potato and iceberg, is there? People rave about the garlic bread and I think it's because the rest of the meal is so mediocre, that the cheesy bread becomes the highlight if the meal. It was just OK. The most inexperienced cook could make it at home with sourdough, butter, and three types of cheese.   A few people in our party ordered the mushroom rice side dish and it was not good. After tasting it, I was grateful to have passed on this wet, mush.   SERVICE: Our waitress was very attentive and responsive. She was more than willing to return the overcooked steaks.   I won't be back, but I'm glad to have visited this historic spot.  Service: 4 stars  Kitch: 4 stars  Food: 1 star","steak, smoked prime rib, naked potato, side salad, garlic bread, mushroom rice"

We saw this beautiful white 3 tiered pyramid shaped cake in a then really big Julia Robert's movie and really wanted that one. We went in to Baker Wee to see if they could make it. The owners were not there and we were told by the manager lady we spoke to that she will be the one making the cake anyway. She saw the movie too and knew exactly what cake we were asking for. We even made a 2D drawing of it, she wrote down her notes and took the order. She said she will rent the movie so she can take one more look at it before she makes it. Fast forward to our wedding day....we arrived at the restaurant where our dinner reception was and for the first time we got to see our cake. WOW! We almost fainted. I should include pictures because there's just no way to describe how ugly it was. The original agreement in size was a 12"" x 12"" square and 10-12"" tall, like I said pyramid. We got an 8"" square base, next layer 6"" base and the top layer 4"" base and the whole cake was 2 feet tall! It looked like a Chinese pagoda. The layers were on 4"" tall sticks. And the best part: it was airbrushed with brown color like marble and had brown 1/2"" diameter ball on the top.. -   Turned out, the owner (who has never seen the movie - or apparently a pyramid before ) ended up making the cake, never called us or the manager lady with questions, just tried to figure it out from the her notes. This was her understanding of it.  We were so embarrassed all night, everyone kept asking what the cake was supposed to be? We just kept saying: a snow white pyramid. Next morning we drove down to the bakery, furious. She said she will not refund the $300 we spent on it because she worked on it all day and she did her best. She said she was sorry and we can have a basic cake ($30 value) for free. We did get that cake a few week later for a birthday and never ever returned to Baker Wee again. It's very sad how greatly it impacted our special day. We should have demanded a refund but we gave up on the arguing back and fourth - it didn't change anything. After all we didn't want the money, we wanted the cake. So anyway, I would not recommend them if they were the last bakery, I  would rather make a homemade cake. I also wish there was a way to choose 0 stars on this on.","none"

As a child, my father would serve them to my brothers and I, but we did whatever we could to avoid them... hunger strikes at the dinner table, temper-tantrums, or simply slipping them into a napkin and pretend to have finished our meal.    As I grew older, I was open to trying them again since my taste buds evolved to enjoy vegetables like broccoli and beets.  Unfortunately, Brussel sprouts left me wanting to scrub my tongue with a toothbrush and mouthwash in order to rid my mouth of the flavor.  When ordering at Dorothy 6, I saw that Brussel sprouts were serves as a side to most dishes.  My burger came with fries, but my boyfriend's meal came with a side of Brussel sprouts.  My burger was simply perfect - juicy, pink, and filled with flavor.  I couldn't have asked for anything better.  Perhaps that's what made me feel adventurous... I grabbed my fork and sampled my boyfriend's Brussel sprouts... I was in love!  How could this be?  My entire life I have despised Brussel sprouts.  The thought of them would make me gag in horror.  Now after trying the sprouts served at Dorothy 6, I crave them!  Where have they been all my life?!    I would go back to Dorothy 6 Blast Furnace Cafe for many reasons: great beer, amazing burgers, pierogis... Now Brussel sprouts are added to that list.  Thank you, Dorothy 6 for changing my mind and mouth about Brussel sprouts.","Brussel sprouts,burger, juicy"

Came to Vegas to celebrate a milestone birthday - and Saturday just seemed to want us to be at Encore Beach Club the entire day/night. First, we attended Diplo, with some promoter price tickets for the guys and the ladies on a free list. Came around 11 to avoid the line - easy-peasy. We ate there, while letting the sunscreen dry, then spent the whole afternoon dancing and splashing. The staff was great, the people as well-  there was hard partying but no fights or any such ratchetness, just people from all over having the time of our lives. The rave-booty was twerk-tacular. There were spankings. The bartenders seemed to be having more fun than the people drinking. All I saw were smiles. You could see Diplo from any of the pools, except perhaps the front middle as people stand and dance in front of the DJ. We danced with our group of 8 (4 couples) and met plenty of nice people.   As more of my group came in from all over, we came back for Marshmello Saturday night (Nightswim!), whom I hadn't seen since EDC last year. We got a great table on a lily-pad off the pool (not on the pool) just in case there was gratuitous splashing, we'd want a dry drinking spot haha. Our view was fantastic, table was perfect, the VIP even invited us into the small VIP pool behind us.   We got a great package that started with 2 magnums of grey goose, which did great for our group. I was impressed how they handled both my large group (12 on table, 14 total that night) and the speed-bump of my credit-card declining as I forgot to tell the bank I was leaving the state. My Host Alexia, beholder of a supernatural beauty, waited patiently and kindly while I called the card and had them over-ride the security hold. She was calm and pleasant, and simply said ""this happens all the time."" (This was in stark contrast to the treatment at Omnia the night before where the bartender threatened to have my friend arrested when his card declined).   Alexia and her runner, damn I totally forgot his name (even he was a really nice guy), treated us incredibly well. She came back and poured drinks throughout the night, not just the obligatory first round. They also made sure we stayed hydrated! Super important when it's 100 at night. They gave us just the right amount of attention and class.   Thank you guys, and special thanks to Alvin for the rockstar treatment at the door. Saturday night was the cherry on top of my birthday weekend!! Truly I don't expect anything less from Encore/Wynn (XS, Surrender/Encore Beach Club) - I never get anything less than the best experience there, over the span of years that I have both attended with tickets and tables. They are the best, they will always be the best.   Thanks again! :-)","none"

Back when Downtown was still a neighborhood where only the most diehard entrepreneurs dared to tread, you could find one of these small neighborhood shops selling everything from wine and beer, to snacks, to cooking essentials, and even a few household cleaning items.  The relatively new Pure Fillmore apartment complex is currently the first of what will undoubtedly be many new apartment and condo complexes lining 7th Avenue in Downtown.  But for now, the nearest full sized grocery store requires a car.  All the more reason URBO's location makes sense.  You'll find URBO on the bottom floor of the Pure Fillmore Apartments on Fillmore Street just east of 7th Avenue.  The brainchild of DeSoto Central Market alum Shawn Connelly, you enter here through the front patio area (where there's seating for eight by the way).  Inside, its a whole lot of stuff mixed into a small space.  Behind the counter, you can get coffee, tea, or even a sandwich made on the spot.  In front of the counter, it's essentially a small independent convenience store with many of the things you'd expect.  Candy bars, meds, condiments, snacks, microwavable items, beer, wine, soda, as well as odds and ends like tissue paper, shampoo, and storage bags.  I can well imagine some Downtown college students living in the apartments upstairs too hung over or too tired to drive two miles to Safeway and instead opting for a stop here.  For my first stop here on a Saturday morning, I opted to get a quick morning pick me up.  A tea and a sandwich.  I got their Salted Caramel Iced Tea (also available hot) and their Turkey Sausage Egg & Cheese sandwich on an english muffin.  Both made to order.  Total cost including tax: $10.  Now to be fair, they prepared the sandwich in part using a microwave so we're not talking gourmet here.  Still, the sandwich hit the spot and the sausage in particular was very tasty.  I was also very happy with the tea.  Almost tasted like a southern style sweet tea of sorts with those caramel accents.  A solid breakfast.  So there you have it.  A locally owned business filling a need in an emerging neighborhood.  Nothing pretentious.  Just a good, straight forward, progressive independent convenience store.  Even if you don't live in this quiet corner of Downtown, its worth a look.  Or a sip and bite and it was in my case.","none"

Kelly's has two major issues: cleanliness and service. The booths are covered in crumbs, regardless of the time of night, and the tables often need wiping. Mysterious sticky stains abound.  The service would be so-so if not for this crazy policy: let's say you sit at a table. No waiter has been paying attention to you, so you go to the bar to get a drink. Are you allowed to bring that drink back to your table? No, you have to drink it at the bar! It's a kind of catch-22.

As a vegetarian it seemed like I was eating chicken, but it was cauliflower dumplings. The gobi had a comfort food appeal. The pani puri chaat was weird. I've never had it before, so I don't have a comparison. The description sounded yummy, but it just wasn't. The total cost was about $14. I would recommend this restaurant.

It is, in fact, the only restaurant I have ever been to in Canada (went during a 6-hr Toronto layover), but the bacon+chive poutine was just perfect and everything I wanted. I liked all the components: the fries themselves, the gravy, the cheese curds, and the bacon (it was NOT Canadian bacon but American bacon bits). The name might make it seem like a tourist trap but from looking at the setup, I think it's meant for drunks hungry at 2am.

If your lucky enough to be in the neighbourhood - do not turn down the opportunity to stop in and grab a bite to eat.   There are always daily specials and the menu is posted on the large blackboard as you walk in. There are only 4 or 5 types of wraps and they are all great !    If you get here just before noon you beat the rush, even if you get caught in the line - it's well worth the wait.  Every single item on the menu is terrific !    Today I brought a friend here for a quick lunch and we both had the combo of corn & crab soup and the lamb wrap !! ..........WOW was it fantastic !   The combo is a prefect lunch.   The restaurant is small and seats about 16 at a very large communal table and there are about 4 additional tables in the back space, or if you prefer to sit facing the street, you could be lucky to grab a spot at the window.    In the spring, summer and early fall the patio is open and it is a lovely space to have lunch.   Thanks Ravi - you and your team do a great job and I hope to return soon.","corn & crab soup"

Went there for lunch few days ago for the first time. We were greeted and welcomed. Then I asked for some water but was brought bottle water and was told that ""the tap water was not healthy due to construction""! Really?! That was the weirdest thing I had ever heard!  We were brought some bread which was not very impressive compared to North restaurant or Gilaneh restaurant that bring hot freshly made delicious bread! Then looking at the menu, the first thing I noticed was the high prices, which I think was the highest I had ever seen in a Persian restaurant. Looks like the prices have gone up about 1.5 times since it was opened 2 years ago, based on the menu I found online. To be fair, the portion was big and 2 people with average appetite can share it. I had Soltani kebab and the quality was very good. I just think that at least for lunch the prices need to be more reasonable. They could make the portions less I guess and bring the price down too. Overall I am happy I tried it but don't think I will go there too often.","Soltani kebab, bread"

The food was very good and the drinks were fantastic but more importantly the service was outstanding.  We all started with cocktails - Margaritas and Mojitos.  The Margarita was made with bourbon and rimed with crushed bacon and salt (yes I said bacon).  The Mojitos were fresh and minty.  The one thing I we all really like about the drinks was that they were not too sweet.    We ordered two apps for the table - Lobster Fritters and Braised beef short rib poutine.  OMG the poutine was out of this world!!  The fritters were good but there was no lobster flavor.  I think next time I would just order the vegetable fritters.  For mains we had fried fish tacos, steak burrito, jambalaya and grilled pork chop with red potato salad.  The jambalaya and the pork chop were features. The burritos was very nice.  The steak was a nice medium rare and it came with guacamole and lime crema.  Fish Tacos were delish!  The corn tortillas really make a difference.  The pork chop feature was really good.  My friend found it to be a little fatty but for those of us who love pork fat it was perfect.  The only dish that fell short was the Jambalya.  The sausage in the dish had great flavor but the overall dish didn't seem to come together.    You would think by now we would be full but we sucked it up and ordered dessert. Two sweet potato pies, beignets and a Patron creme brulee.  My word it was good. The sweet potato pie was more of a bread pudding with a bourbon carmel sauce.  The creme brulee was one of the best I've had - it had a lovely fresh citrus flavor.  The beignets were tougher than I expected but still good.  I would like to point something out about this place.  No the food isn't cheap but the quality of the ingredients justifies the cost.  Our meal with tax and tip was $200 (for four).  The food was really good but what sets them apart is the service.  The restuarant was fairly busy and there was only one waiter who had the assitance of the owners Amy and Albert.  Yes there were times when we seemed to be waiting awhile for things but they made sure that we never felt forgotton.  They went out of their way to talk to us and make us feel welcome.  I've been to some really nice restaurants and had some incredible food but I've never been made to feel as welcome as did at The Combine Eatery.","lobster fritters, braised beef short rib poutine, vegetable fritters, fried fish tacos, steak burritos, jambalaya, grilled pork chop, red potato salad, sweet potato pie, beignets, creme brulee"

It's got the appeal of calculated imitation that is the Adult Disneyworld but still has the polish of the Unrestrained Opulence that Las Vegas is evolving to--sort of Dubai with gambling.  The crowd here is very diverse, with wealthy foreign tourists both as guests and herded through the shopping mall under the auspices of paid tour guides. Certainly it's a monument to global ambition.  Indeed, Vegas is evolving, and I can imagine that when it opened the Venetian was the pinnacle of elegance on the strip.  While no longer at the summit, it still is a fantastic place to stay at.  The rooms are decorated in classic Italian motif, and are fairly spacious.  Some of the aspects of the room were showing their age (we did need to call maintenance at one point).    The property is indeed huge, with a lot to offer--top notch dining, upscale shopping, and considerable entertainment (Venetian troubadors, gondola rides, shows, casinos).  The scale of the operation can be put into perspective by recounting my check-in experience.  I felt like I was boarding a cruise ship with the crowds, the processing, the walk to the cabin--all excellently done, but if that's not what you are looking for in a vacation you may need to re-think the Vegas thing.  We went off-peak (during the week) and felt the room rates were a good deal.  If I ever go back to Vegas, I'll consider staying again.","none"

These did not disappoint, but I wouldn't say they are truly singular in their yumminess. My review is based solely on these, as we did not try the desserts or anything else. Some of the bagels seemed ""fresher"" than others, and if you've ever had a NYC bagel before 8am, you know the expectations I have. I also feel like the bagels were kinda skinny, and the holes were big. I'm used to really fat, chewy but pillowy ones. Sigh.  But it really pains me to give anything lower than 4 stars, as they have a lot of traditional Jewish/NYC deli delicacies, which you really don't see out here in LV.

The setting is in an old pecan grove with mature trees, and grass.  A very relaxed kind of place to just enjoy the Phoenix weather the food and those you are with.  It closes during the Summer and I can't wait for it to open back up in the Fall.  The perfect ending however, are the deserts.  They are all hommade, and terrific.  I can't get past the pecan pie, perhaps the best in Phoenix.  The crust is just right flaky, and it's loaded with pecans.

We stumbled in on Friday around 7pm to a karaoke night! Everyone seemed to know one another and felt like family (some may have actually been family. It was so intimate they even celebrated the monthly birthdays and sang to a woman with a birthday crown on. Definitely felt like a regular karaoke group that returns each week. Everyone welcomed us, even new people that came in said hello and told us about the karaoke nights and to come back again soon. Despite the closeness of the patrons we didn't feel like an outsider.   Food: You go and order at the counter and then sit and they will bring it to you. The woman at the counter was very friendly and helped us making our decisions. They have a wide variety of items including ice cream, coffee, desserts, salads, sandwiches, breakfast, tea, etc. Very reasonably priced menu! I got the tuna melt, it was just ok.

We stumbled in on Friday around 7pm to a karaoke night! Everyone seemed to know one another and felt like family (some may have actually been family. It was so intimate they even celebrated the monthly birthdays and sang to a woman with a birthday crown on. Definitely felt like a regular karaoke group that returns each week. Everyone welcomed us, even new people that came in said hello and told us about the karaoke nights and to come back again soon. Despite the closeness of the patrons we didn't feel like an outsider.   Food: You go and order at the counter and then sit and they will bring it to you. The woman at the counter was very friendly and helped us making our decisions. They have a wide variety of items including ice cream, coffee, desserts, salads, sandwiches, breakfast, tea, etc. Very reasonably priced menu! I got the tuna melt, it was just ok.

For example serving Jewish Latkes, Israeli/middle eastern humus, and Greek moussaka is usually just too much for a fusion.   And yet, the food was tasty! Even tough it wasn't 100% loyal to the original flavors or shapes of the Middle East the food was yummy! And I do have to give them a round of applause for their hummus. Simply really good!  The lamb shawarma was also good. And branzino fish with labaneh was on point.   Even though our hostess did a terrible job, our server was lovely.   So bottom line. Worth visiting.

We started out sharing the french onion soup, a caesar salad and the tater tots.  All were delicious.  The croutons were homemade on the salad and very flavorful.  The soup was served in a litte crock and was very cheesy.  The tater tots were not my favorite in town, but they are still good.  They are homemade and served with tomato jelly instead of ketchup.  Main Course:  I had the delmonico ribeye, oscar style.  The steak was done perfectly and the crab meat and bernaise were amazing.  I could barely eat 1/2 of my meat!  My guest had the lobster mac n' cheese, which is very different, but very delicious.  There was plenty of lobster meat and it was a large portion.  There was spinach, mushrooms and other things mixed in, which is different.  We had a side of asparagus, which was amazing.  Cooked perfectly al dente.  We also had the ""canon"" potato on the side, upon recommenation from our server.  I am SO glad I tried this.  It is actually an English food called ""bubble and squeak."" Mashed potatoes are sauteed with bacon and chopped cabbage and then topped with a cheese sauce.  Sounds strange, but it was a great combination!  I would go back for that dish alone.  For dessert we shared the fresh apple cobbler topped with cinammon ice cream.  It was warm and delicious, like an apple pie fresh out of the oven.  Overall, I love the place.  They have a raw bar that often has happy hour specials for $1 oysters.  It is not too casual, but also not fussy.  Everyone is very friendly and welcoming and the food is great!","potato"

The soup was served in a litte crock and was very cheesy.  The tater tots were not my favorite in town, but they are still good.  They are homemade and served with tomato jelly instead of ketchup.  Main Course:  I had the delmonico ribeye, oscar style.  The steak was done perfectly and the crab meat and bernaise were amazing.  I could barely eat 1/2 of my meat!  My guest had the lobster mac n' cheese, which is very different, but very delicious.  There was plenty of lobster meat and it was a large portion.  There was spinach, mushrooms and other things mixed in, which is different.  We had a side of asparagus, which was amazing.  Cooked perfectly al dente.  We also had the ""canon"" potato on the side, upon recommenation from our server.  I am SO glad I tried this.  It is actually an English food called ""bubble and squeak."" Mashed potatoes are sauteed with bacon and chopped cabbage and then topped with a cheese sauce.  Sounds strange, but it was a great combination!  I would go back for that dish alone.  For dessert we shared the fresh apple cobbler topped with cinammon ice cream.  It was warm and delicious, like an apple pie fresh out of the oven.  Overall, I love the place.  They have a raw bar that often has happy hour specials for $1 oysters.  It is not too casual, but also not fussy.  Everyone is very friendly and welcoming and the food is great!","none"

Both times big let down. I order through Postmates several times a week and rarely ever have any issues so I know it's nothing they could of prevented unless the drivers start sampling the food and drinks before delivery. I ordered the regular chicken florentine - crepe was cold, doughy and undercooked. It was generously stuffed, almost too much. Spinach was fresh, but not cooked so it was like eating a salad in my crepe...the mushrooms, clearly were canned precooked mushrooms. I'm not totally offended by them, but when you put a ton in a raw crepe...not really tasty. Iced latte- there is no option to NOT add flavoring which is baffling in itself. Flavoring should be a option not a requirement. Given I can't stand sugar filled syrup pretending to be caramel in my coffee, in the special notes section, I specifically asked NO flavoring, and add a extra shot. Guess who got a caramel syrup latte?  This girl. Why even have the special requests field if you aren't going to read it? This happened the first time I ordered. I don't know if they can't see the notes or figure it can be put on Postmates. It's all very confusing. Chocolate croissant- tasty, seemed fresh. Nothing special but compared to my $10 crepe and watered down overly flavored latte it shined.  Dear management, read your reviews. Common theme, crepes are undercooked. If you are going to be so bold to name your establishment after a certain food, you best knock it out of the park. IHOP makes a better chicken Florentine crepe. That's shameful. I gave it two shots both were overpriced let downs. Their space can't seem to keep a business longer than 2 years. I'll be shocked if they stick around.","hicken florentine, coffee, caramel syrup latte, chocolate croissant,"

I also ordered the lamb curry (I forgot the exact name.. Rendang?) the flavor was good but I didn't like the taste of the meat the chicken or beef version is probably better. The lamb meat I feel tastes like lamb sweat. At least that's what I imagined it to be. I only gave it 4 stars because I wasn't satisfied with the lamb meat and some of the items there were a bit pricey. Other than that it's excellent and I like their beverages that they have a grass jelly drink and Malaysian iced tea :).

This place is a bit more authentic than the average Canuck might like.   It's also tucked away off Davis Drive and off Harry Walker so the only way to find it is to look behind the hotel.   The noodle dishes are great, and the Pad Thai is less sweet and more interesting than usual. Portions can be a bit on the small side, but so is the dining room.   I have been back a few times so far, and this won't be the last time. It has room to grow on me, and so does the rating.   Let me be clear: this food tastes much better than Mandarin, but is less mainstream than the late Chitose. Newmarket is so desolate in the ""good Chinese food"" category that Cambodian Noodle King is my go to when I can't justify a drive to Markham.","Pad Thai"

I tend to break things down into categories, so I'll go with that for now. Atmosphere: Confusing. Decor is kinda kitschy, supposedly to evoke dinner at mom's or something of that order. Yeah, if you have really loud obnoxious relatives; maybe it's due to the construction of the space, but the place was LOUD! For the price (more about that later), this is a special-occasion restaurant for most of us, but I wouldn't recommend it for an romantic/intimate one.  Service: No complaints here. Our server (Eric, I believe) was extremely pleasant and most helpful. He took the time to explain some of the menu items, checked on us fairly often, and  was generally very friendly. High marks here. Food (quality): Again, very few complaints. Food was fresh and flavorful; portions, while not huge, were pretty satisfying. My wife had the roasted beet salad (actually part of the 4-course special but our server told us we could order it a la carte) and enjoyed it very much. I started with the Caesar...the black garlic dressing was delicious! Highly recommended!  My wife's filet mignon was well prepared and presented; I had the brick oven chicken and was very pleased. Moist, tasty, and the mac & cheese was excellent. Topped off with the Brookie for dessert, a very nice meal. Food (value): And here's why I tend to shun trendy restaurants. A cocktail, a glass of wine, a beer, 2 salads, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert: just this side of $140. Brief breakdown: the beer, although a John Smith from England, was served out of a can! Some may call this ""ironic""; I say, ""tacky!"" The aforementioned beet salad? A few pieces of beet, a little arugula, a dollop of ricotta...$14! And although my chicken was very good, one medium-sized chicken breast doesn't warrant a price over $20. And before the Summerlin crowd starts chanting ""Go back to Denny's"", I'm talking value, not price. My last two steakhouse meals (Silverado and Circus Circus) were each about $30 less for a comparable meal. So, all in all, good, not great, and not worth the price.","roasted beet salad, caesar, filet mignon, brick oven chicken, brookie,"

We spoke to the manager and the Waiter for the rest of the orders.  They said to check on our orders.  My kids got hungry and only ate fried rice that came.

Is the Chef inconsistent or just trying too hard to be creative? I am always drawn to a menu with wine pairings. On new year last though, Bricco had a menu that didn't flow well and some of the wine pairings just didn't make sense to the point of requesting (and thankfully receiving) a replacement wine.

The rice was kind of greasy and there was not much taste. The only thing that made the food different from other middle-east style eateries was the salad dressing which my boyfriend thought tasted like Big Mac sauce, and this other sauce for the meat that he said tasted kind of like salsa (not that it was bad, just saying).  The actual venue was extremely busy; we went at about 8pm on a Saturday night. There was a lot of tables in the restaurant but they were all full. A varied mix of people; families with children, groups of friends, couples... everyone. We decided to get takeout because really hectic restaurants are uncomfortable to me.  I would not go out of my way again for a meal here, but if I happen to be in the area and I am hungry, I would probably go for some naan or something.

I was so dissapointed with everything that once I got home I had to write a review.  First of All I am Vietnamese and Pho is such a soulful dish, the pho I had today was the worst thing ever.  My parents came to visit with my sister and a friend, and after a long day we wanted to finish with a hot bowl of pho.  I have seen this place, I have even walked by it when I ate at Sura.  There was a smell so tantalizing that I had to go and try it. I thought it would be a good idea to try Jenni Pho Grill tonight.  We walk in saw that the place was not too busy maybe about 7 tables.  We got seated fairly quickly.  Our server was pretty nice, my parents attempted to order in vietnamese but the server informed us that he did not speak it.  Cool cool, no big deal, he seemed like a nice kid.  After that it went downhill from there.  We ordered three bowls of the Pho Dac biet, and two orders of the pho tai.  We finished our order with two thai teas, the jenni jelly drink, and two waters.    My family waited around, no waters, no drinks nothing.  We watched three tables get seated order their food and get their food before we even had anything on our table!  after a 25 min wait, our waiter finally comes back with two waters.  We asked why the service was so slow, he stated that there was only two waiters and said sorry.  So it was fine for now.  After we got the water nothing else came to us.  We watched as the tables that came in after us eat, and one even finished before we were served.  After another 35 minutes, our food finally came out.  First the two dac biet bowls, then the last three.  Finally the drinks came out as well.  I have worked at a boba place before, making thai teas should not take a hour.  For waiting for so long I was really anticipating for a great bowl of pho.  Oh man was I wrong.  The broth was lukewarm, it could not even finish cooking my meat.  The broth tasty funky as if it was made with a pre made powder.  My parents and I watched a one cook was constantly tasting the broth, and we saw no bones that make a great broth.  The bowl was mostly disappointing broth.  There were very little meat and noodles.  We ate, and we wanted to get out as soon as possible.  We asked for a to go cup for the thai tea because it took so long we were just going to take it home.  It took almost another five minutes just to get a plastic cup.    In the end it was just terrible.  My family and I went home unhappy.  And the thing is I love food, I work in the industry so I timing is very important.  Having only two servers is rough but it can not be the only excuse.  If there was something wrong or if it was going to take a little longer, they should inform the customers.  The worst part was watching tables come in before us and eat before we got anything.  I am never going back.  I really hope they clean up their act, there are a lot of pho places out here and if they don't fix things it will be buried beneath the rest.","Vietnamese and Pho, Jenni Pho Gril, Pho Dac biet,  pho tai,  thai teas, the jenni jelly drink"

Luckily, Burrito Bandidos was not too far a walk, and it certainly did not disappoint.   I ordered a large Mango Chicken burrito, complete with everything, short of jalapenos. I waited around 5 minutes for the order to be completed, which seemed shorter than most of the reviews here. (Although, most of them seem outdated.) The chicken was fairly juicy and tender, and the ingredients tasted fresh. My only complaint would be that the mango chicken was around a dollar more than the regular chicken, and the only thing you got were roughly julienne-d apple mango slices. Nice, tangy addition, but not worth the extra cost in my opinion.   I would drop by again if I was in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to return. 4/5","Mango Chicken burrito"

This could be any of the relatively higher chain restos that feels like it needs an update but maybe that's just me?  The food is the thing in any restaurant and pretty much everything was just ok. Our salesman/server;) confidently stated the steak tacos were the best menu item, and they were, but still only rated a just above average 3.5.  I had a ribeye with mashed and seasonal vegetables that was not coked to medium as requested (who knows why they ask in spots like this because it is pretty much never done right?). The accompanying sauce was actually very good and that saved this dish for me.  If Union Social was located closer to where we live it might merit another chance but we live in the south end of Mississauga and thus will be sticking closer to home.","ribeye with mashed and seasonal vegetables"

A friend who lived in Japan says unsalted is the default, but isn't the way I prefer. The crab legs were not great either, but crab legs are not what brought me to this buffet, it was the opportunity to eat an irresponsible amount of sushi and then be able to complain about it on the Internet if they asked me to exercise even a bit of discretion. They did not interrupt my my unrestrained gluttony. I appreciated this at the time, but I wonder how they sleep at night watching gastronomic self destruction shift after shift.  I thought the sushi was pretty good. I went in the afternoon (paying dinner buffet price) on the weekend. The selection was pretty good, and every time I returned, there was more stuff. It really surprised me that they had sashimi, which was well cut. They had a good variety of sashimi, and only one was strong (but I dont remember ... maybe the hamachi?). The rolls were rolled well, too.  As for freshness, only what I think was the hamachi was maybe off. I am sure it depends on when you go. I tipped the guys working the buffet (as well as my server) because I thought they were good enough to warrant it.  The service was friendly. I thought it was weird that drinks come in massive beer steins, which do not exactly mesh with the contemporary Asian fusion decor, which is classy and understated.  There was a group there (I think it was somebody's birthday or engagement or something) and it was clear that this is a good place for a group of people to go.  If you want to eat a lot of sushi, or want to go to a restaurant with a variety of Asian dishes, plus a lot of sushi that is not expensive, this is a good choice. I wish it wasn't in bumblefuck South Kankakee, and I hope that the location doesn't deep-six the place, but I will be back.","edemame, crab legs, sushi, sashimi,"

We had a reservation for 8:15 but showed up around 7:30 and they told us our table was waiting for us. Their tables are quite distant from each other, so you can actually listen to what your friends are saying 5 stars so far! After we made our order we got bread and olives, which is typical for Portuguese restaurants I guess. I don't go to too many, so I'm not an expert. Bread was okay, but kind of generic. 3 stars for that Food was another matter. We ordered the appetizer platter and some shrimp on the side. Everything was really good, and tasty. Their portions aren't even small, cause I felt  I was getting full by the time we finished the appetizers. For main dish we all tried something different - seafood and meat. If you go there go for the seafood! My duck breast was tasty, but the portion felt small. My meal was the smallest of all. I didn't leave hungry so it didn't bother me. Overall, I'd say food is really delicious, but not so imaginative. I felt like you can have some of the dishes at other places. 4* here Desert: I ordered the creme caramel and everyone tried it. Everyone got wowed by it! I haven't tried creme caramel in a long time, but it was definitely what you should order if you ever visit 5* on that Service: attentive and polite. Not much else to say. I have no remarks! The waiter was a really nice guy. This could be considered both good and bad, but I felt we had to wait too long to get our main dishes. I didn't care cause we were already having a good time, but for someone who's in a hurry it might be a problem 4.5 stars on service  Tried the Portuguese beer which was nice, but expensive.   To sum it up, while the place might not be exactly 5 stars if I have to be more objective. My score reflects my overall experience from dining in there.  Would I go back again? On a good occasion for sure. This place should also be perfect for a more quiet and romantic dinner!","bread and olives, shrimp, duck breast, creme caramel"

I was just not in the mood, so I ordered french onion soup and buttermilk fried chicken breast. I never order fried chicken...but the server was correct that it was a hidden jewel on the menu. Moist, and Southern comfort food at its best.   Expect a large bill, but its Vegas, which means no more inexpensive meals.

Got my food at the window I always do a quality check no matter what, looked at my sandwich and it had honey mustard on it, last time I checked honey mustard and ranch were two different things. So I sent it back, the girl who made it came to the window and argued that it was made correctly. I said no, because Asiago ranch isn't yellow and doesn't taste like honey mustard.  She said I know I made it right I said ok, well I don't want it. So she took it back brought me another one this time a regular chicken sandwich with a ranch packet. Yeah I paid 7 dollars for a ranch packet with a chicken sandwich. Sweet girl right, nasty attitude to boot. So I took it into the store this time, and the manager showed me the ranch in the bottle that was suppose to be on my sandwich and remade it. Wow imagine that someone who new how to make it without attitude. I'm still very disappointed money is money no matter where you spend it at. And I expect to get what I ask for with my money.

I knew things were bad even as we approached the entrance. I could hear the music blaring from down the walkway, and when we walked in I felt like I was going deaf. The DJ they had was cranking his levels to obnoxious extremes, and with the sterile decor the sound was bouncing in all the wrong directions. It didn't help that the DJ was terrible to begin with.  The bartenders ranged from jock-like dudes and cleavage-heavy women. All of them seemed slow at their jobs and were too consumed pouring dozens of shots and making fancy drinks to get any of us a simple beer. We drank pints of Kronenbourg, which tasted really off and quite gross.  The washroom situation was one I wish I could have avoided: a bunch of drunk dudes waiting in line and hitting on any woman who happened to be waiting as well. I let a couple girls go ahead of me in order to avoid the onslaught of lame pick-up lines.  The crowd was a mixed bag. My girlfriend said the only people who go here are people who already live in Liberty Village, which makes sense seeing as I don't see why anyone who lives elsewhere in Toronto would specifically make there way here.  We stayed here for about 30 minutes. Terrible in every category.","none"

Twice for dinner and once for Sunday brunch. Absolutely love this place!   We had the buttermilk half chicken ($17), green beans (special side, changes often. Added $3 on top of chicken) and sloppy joe fries ($14). The portions are really big. I packed a doggy bag from dinner both times. The buttermilk chicken is so crispy and fresh. You can choose to make the chicken spicy for an additional $2. We didn't do that because I'm not into spicy food.  The green beans were baked with cheese on it, which was unique and delicious. The joe fries were really good. They did not skim on the ingredients. A lot of meat! The sunny side up egg was a nice touch. This dish has a kick so beware non-spicy eaters!   The second time I went for dinner, I had the chicken again and a side of cider slaw. The chicken is always good and the slaw wasn't bad. I also had a toffee pudding cake with caramel and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Pretty sweet, but rich and tasty. Good to share with 2 people.   Overall, dinner was great. Only complaint was that the food did take about 20 mins to come both times. I think it's because the chicken was made to order so beware of this if you are on a time constraint. Definitely worth the wait though.   The brunch is only available on Sundays. We had the turkey croissant (special item, changes weekly, I believe. About $14, can't remember exact amount), Scottish eggs ($10) hickory bacon ($4) and homemade ginger beer. Everything was so fresh and flavourful! Loved the brunch here!  The food is on the pricier side, about $25 to $30 a person for dinner and $15 to $20 for brunch, but you pay for what you get here. Totally worth it. Service is okay.
